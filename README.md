This repo provides supplemental material for the work titled: "Management in Business Analytics: An Ego-Network Approach." The goal of this study is to provide empirical evidence on how well connected is the term "management" with the bigram "business analytics." A scrutiny of this relationship is relevant for several reasons. First, it will help business school professors understand the landscape that lies ahead for business school students in a more precise way. Second, it pinpoints a possible list of topics, concepts, methodologies, or technological approaches that should be part of the educational curriculum for both undergraduate and graduate levels. Finally, it might help identify novel opportunities for interdisciplinary team-building purposes.
