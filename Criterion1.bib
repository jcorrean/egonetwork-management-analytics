abstract={The paper investigates the relationship between analytical capabilities in the plan, source, make and deliver area of the supply chain and its performance using information system support and business process orientation as moderators. Structural equation modeling employs a sample of 310 companies from different industries from the USA, Europe, Canada, Brazil and China. The findings suggest the existence of a statistically significant relationship between analytical capabilities and performance. The moderation effect of information systems support is considerably stronger than the effect of business process orientation. The results provide a better understanding of the areas where the impact of business analytics may be the strongest. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The popularity of big data and business analytics has increased tremendously in the last decade and a key challenge for organizations is in understanding how to leverage them to create business value. However, while the literature acknowledges the importance of these topics little work has addressed them from the organization's point of view. This paper investigates the challenges faced by organizational managers seeking to become more data and information-driven in order to create value. Empirical research comprised a mixed methods approach using (1) a Delphi study with practitioners through various forums and (2) interviews with business analytics managers in three case organizations. The case studies reinforced the Delphi findings and highlighted several challenge focal areas: organizations need a clear data and analytics strategy, the right people to effect a data-driven cultural change, and to consider data and information ethics when using data for competitive advantage. Further, becoming data-driven is not merely a technical issue and demands that organizations firstly organize their business analytics departments to comprise business analysts, data scientists, and IT personnel, and secondly align that business analytics capability with their business strategy in order to tackle the analytics challenge in a systemic and joined-up way. As a result, this paper presents a business analytics ecosystem for organizations that contributes to the body of scholarly knowledge by identifying key business areas and functions to address to achieve this transformation. © 2017},

abstract={Synthesizing prior research, this paper designs a relatively comprehensive and holistic characterization of business analytics - one that serves as a foundation on which researchers, practitioners, and educators can base their studies of business analytics. As such, it serves as an initial ontology for business analytics as a field of study. The foundation has three main parts dealing with the whence and whither of business analytics: identification of dimensions along which business analytics possibilities can be examined, derivation of a six-class taxonomy that covers business analytics perspectives in the literature, and design of an inclusive framework for the field of business analytics. In addition to unifying the literature, a major contribution of the designed framework is that it can stimulate thinking about the nature, roles, and future of business analytics initiatives. We show how this is done by deducing a host of unresolved issues for consideration by researchers, practitioners, and educators. We find that business analytics involves issues quite aside from data management, number crunching, technology use, systematic reasoning, and so forth. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The nature of management accountants' responsibility is evolving from merely reporting aggregated historical value to also including organizational performance measurement and providing management with decision related information. Corporate information systems such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have provided management accountants with both expanded data storage power and enhanced computational power. With big data extracted from both internal and external data sources, management accountants now could utilize data analytics techniques to answer the questions including: what has happened (descriptive analytics), what will happen (predictive analytics), and what is the optimized solution (prescriptive analytics). However, research shows that the nature and scope of managerial accounting has barely changed and that management accountants employ mostly descriptive analytics, some predictive analytics, and a bare minimum of prescriptive analytics. This paper proposes a Managerial Accounting Data Analytics (MADA) framework based on the balanced scorecard theory in a business intelligence context. MADA provides management accountants the ability to utilize comprehensive business analytics to conduct performance measurement and provide decision related information. With MADA, three types of business analytics (descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive) are implemented into four corporate performance measurement perspectives (financial, customer, internal process, and learning and growth) in an enterprise system environment. Other related issues that affect the successful utilization of business analytics within a corporate-wide business intelligence (BI) system, such as data quality and data integrity, are also discussed.

abstract={Over the past few decades, with the development of automatic identification, data capture and storage technologies, people generate data much faster and collect data much bigger than ever before in business, science, engineering, education and other areas. Big data has emerged as an important area of study for both practitioners and researchers. It has huge impacts on data-related problems. In this paper, we identify the key issues related to big data analytics and then investigate its applications specifically related to business problems. ©, This work was authored as part of the Contributor's official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

abstract={Supply chain management has become more important as an academic topic due to trends in globalization leading to massive reallocation of production related advantages. Because of the massive amount of data that is generated in the global economy, new tools need to be developed in order to manage and analyze the data, as well as to monitor organizational performance worldwide. This paper proposes a framework of business analytics for supply chain analytics (SCA) as IT-enabled, analytical dynamic capabilities composed of data management capability, analytical supply chain process capability, and supply chain performance management capability. This paper also presents a dynamic-capabilities view of SCA and extensively describes a set of its three capabilities: data management capability, analytical supply chain process capability, and supply chain performance management capability. Next, using the SCM best practice, sales & operations planning (S&OP), the paper demonstrates opportunities to apply SCA in an integrated way. In discussing the implications of the proposed framework, finally, the paper examines several propositions predicting the positive impact of SCA and its individual capability on SCM performance. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Business analytics is a revolution that is impossible to miss. At its core, business analytics is about leveraging value from data. Instead of being referred to as the 'sludge of the information age,' data has recently been deemed 'the new oil.' While data can be employed for purposes such as detecting new opportunities, identifying market niches, and developing new products and services, it is also notoriously amorphous and hard to extract value from. In this Guest Editors' Perspective, we first present a structural framework for deriving value from business analytics. Extracting value from data requires aligning strategy and desirable behaviors to business performance management in conjunction with analytic tasks and capabilities. We then introduce three special articles that provide in-depth insights regarding how business analytics is being employed in the management of healthcare, accounting, and supply chains. © 2014.},

abstract={Collecting, analyzing, and extracting valuable information from a large amount of data requires easily accessible, robust, computational and analytical tools. Data Mining and Business Analytics with R utilizes the open source software R for the analysis, exploration, and simplification of large high-dimensional data sets. As a result, readers are provided with the needed guidance to model and interpret complicated data and become adept at building powerful models for prediction and classification. Highlighting both underlying concepts and practical computational skills, Data Mining and Business Analytics with R begins with coverage of standard linear regression and the importance of parsimony in statistical modeling. The book includes important topics such as penalty-based variable selection (LASSO); logistic regression; regression and classification trees; clustering; principal components and partial least squares; and the analysis of text and network data. In addition, the book presents: A thorough discussion and extensive demonstration of the theory behind the most useful data mining tools. Illustrations of how to use the outlined concepts in real-world situations. Readily available additional data sets and related R code allowing readers to apply their own analyses to the discussed materials. Numerous exercises to help readers with computing skills and deepen their understanding of the material. Data Mining and Business Analytics with R is an excellent graduate-level textbook for courses on data mining and business analytics. The book is also a valuable reference for practitioners who collect and analyze data in the fields of finance, operations management, marketing, and the information sciences. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

abstract={How to align business analytics with process orientation initiatives and how management can influence a synergistic accomplishment of these two elements in order to streamline organizational performance is a foremost managerial issue. By means of a quantitative research effort, a study was designed to investigate the relationships among these constructs. Empirical data were collected in 2011 from a survey of 368 large and mid-sized industrial and service companies headquartered in Brazil. A quantitative analysis was performed, and both the reliability and validity of the scales were evaluated prior to using structural equation modeling. The results demonstrate that the direct effects among BPO, analytical indicators and performance can be taken as statistically significant. The findings also demonstrate that BPO and analytical indicators can be taken as predictors of performance. The paper discusses these results and their managerial implications, as well as some research paths for future studies on the topic. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={While the topic of analytics is rapidly growing in popularity across various domains, there is still a relatively low amount of empirical work in the field of operations research (OR). While studies of various technical and business aspects of analytics are emerging in OR, little has been done to address how the OR community can leverage business analytics in dynamic and uncertain environments – the very place where OR is supposed to play a key role. To address this gap, this study draws on the dynamic capabilities view of the firm and builds on eight selected case studies of operations research activity in large organisations, each of which have invested significantly in analytics technology and implementation. The study identifies fourteen analytics-enabled micro-foundations of dynamic capabilities, essentially highlighting how organisations can use analytics to manage and enhance their OR activities in dynamic and uncertain environments. This study also identifies six key cross-cutting propositions emerging from the data and develops a roadmap for future OR researchers to address these issues and improve the use and value of analytics as enablers of organisational dynamic capabilities. © 2019},

abstract={Business analytics has the potential to deliver performance gains and competitive advantage. However, a theoretically grounded model identifying the factors and processes involved in realizing those performance gains has not been clearly articulated in the literature. This paper draws on the literature on dynamic capabilities to develop such a theoretical framework. It identifies the critical roles of organizational routines and organization-wide capabilities for identifying, resourcing and implementing business analytics-based competitive actions in delivering performance gains and competitive advantage.

abstract={Previous research has demonstrated that business analytics systems create value and provide competitive advantage for organisations. We argue that organisational and dynamic capabilities, enabled by business analytics systems, can explain how value is created, sustained and renewed. An evolutionary, process-oriented theoretical framework describes how dynamic and organisational capabilities interact over time to create value. The framework is then used to explain how business analytics systems provided value and competitive advantage in a longitudinal case study of a large financial institution. Several critical success factors for the use of business analytics are identified and implications are discussed. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Purpose: Over the past few years, developments in business analytics have provided strategic planners with promising instruments for dealing with turbulent environments. This study aims to reveal whether or not the application of business analytics in strategic planning contributes to better company performance, and to formulate recommendations on how to integrate business analytics in companies' performance management systems. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a survey conducted with 89 respondents from high-technology firms, a group comparison between firms with strong performance and those with weak performance reveals significant differences between the two groups' strategic planning processes and application of business analytics. Findings: The empirical survey's results show that better-performing companies are characterized by a more sophisticated analytical planning process. Lower-performing firms acknowledge this competitive advantage. Based on these findings, the authors develop recommendations on how to integrate business analytics in performance management contexts. Research limitations: The empirical study's results are limited to high-technology industries in the cultural setting of Germany. Practical implications: The empirical results emphasize the competitive advantage gained by applying business analytics. The recommendations concerning analytical performance management should help managers to sensibly integrate the analytical toolbox in performance management contexts. Originality/value: This paper combines insights on the best usage of business analytics from the perspective of strategic planning experts, with recommendations for the integration of business analytics into the performance management framework from an academic perspective. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Business analytics (BA) becomes increasingly important under rapidly changing business environment. A research challenge is that BA use is not fully understood. We tackle this challenge from the perspective of dynamic capability by using an empirical model with the emphasis on BA use in customer relationship management (CRM). Based on 170 samples from firm-level survey, we analyze the nomological linkage from IT competence to CRM performance. The results show data management capability fully mediates between IT competence and BA use, while customer response capability partially mediates between BA use and CRM performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={It is well known that professional sports teams have made extensive use of analytics to improve their on-field performance. However, it is not as apparent that these same organizations use analytics to improve performance on the "business" side. The North American professional sports industry is unique in that the teams operate as legal monopolies/duopolies, with very few cities having more than one major-league team in a particular sport. Thus, our intent is to explore the adoption and assessment of business analytics in professional sports organizations. An empirical analysis is conducted concerning management's perception of the effects of business analytics as well as the actual change in financial performance since the adoption of analytics by the organizations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Although business analytics (BA) have been increasingly adopted into businesses, there is limited empirical research examining the drivers of each stage of BA adoption in organizations. Drawing upon technological-organizational-environmental framework and innovation diffusion process, we developed an integrative model to examine BA adoption processes and tested with 170 Korean firms. The analysis shows data-related technological characteristics derive all stages of BA adoption: initiation, adoption and assimilation. While organizational characteristics are associated with adoption and assimilation stage, only competition intensity in environmental characteristics is associated with initiation stage. Our findings help practitioners and researchers to understand what factors can enable companies to adopt BA in each stage. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Big data and business analytics are trends that are positively impacting the business world. Past researches show that data generated in the modern world is huge and growing exponentially. These include structured and unstructured data that flood organizations daily. Unstructured data constitute the majority of the world’s digital data and these include text files, web, and social media posts, emails, images, audio, movies, etc. The unstructured data cannot be managed in the traditional relational database management system (RDBMS). Therefore, data proliferation requires a rethinking of techniques for capturing, storing, and processing the data. This is the role big data has come to play. This paper, therefore, is aimed at increasing the attention of organizations and researchers to various applications and benefits of big data technology. The paper reviews and discusses, the recent trends, opportunities and pitfalls of big data and how it has enabled organizations to create successful business strategies and remain competitive, based on available literature. Furthermore, the review presents the various applications of big data and business analytics, data sources generated in these applications and their key characteristics. Finally, the review not only outlines the challenges for successful implementation of big data projects but also highlights the current open research directions of big data analytics that require further consideration. The reviewed areas of big data suggest that good management and manipulation of the large data sets using the techniques and tools of big data can deliver actionable insights that create business values. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={The mechanism of business analytics affordances enhancing the management of cloud computing data security is a key antecedent in improving cloud computing security. Based on information value chain theory and IT affordances theory, a research model is built to investigate the underlying mechanism of business analytics affordances enhancing the management of cloud computing data security. The model includes business analytics affordances, decision-making affordances of cloud computing data security, decision-making rationality of cloud computing data security, and the management of cloud computing data security. Simultaneously, the model considers the role of data-driven culture and IT business process integration. It is empirically tested using data collected from 316 enterprises by Partial Least Squares-based structural equation model. Without data-driven culture and IT business process integration, the results suggest that there is a process from business analytics affordances to decision-making affordances of cloud computing data security, decision-making rationality of cloud computing data security, and to the management of cloud computing data security. Moreover, Data-driven culture and IT business process integration have a positive mediation effect on the relationship between business analytics affordances and decision-making affordances of cloud computing data security. The conclusions in this study provide useful references for the enterprise to strengthen the management of cloud computing data security using business analytics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to demonstrate how the integration of netnography and business analytics can support companies in the process of value creation from social big data by leveraging on customer relationship management and customer knowledge management (CKM). Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts the methodology of a single case study by using desk analysis, netnography and business analytics. The context of analysis has been identified into the case of Aurora Company, a well-known producer of fountain pens. Findings: The case demonstrates how the integration of big data analytics and netnography is relevant for the development of a customer relationship management strategy. The results obtained have been categorized according to the three main categories of customer knowledge, such as knowledge for, from and about customer. Research limitations/implications: This paper presents implications for the advancement of the theory on CKM by demonstrating, as the acquisition, storage and management of data generated by customers on social media require the adoption of a cross-disciplinary approach resulting from the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches. The framework is structured as methodological tool to detect knowledge in virtual community. Practical implications: Practical implications arise for managers and entrepreneurs in terms of value creation from knowledge assets generated on social big data through the management of the customers’ relationship and data-driven innovation patterns. Originality/value: This paper offers an original contribution of integration of well-established research streams. The focus on the knowledge under the perspectives of information assets for, from and about customers in the debate on value creation and management of big data is an element of value offered by this study in addition to the comprehension of strategies of social customer relationship management as actual initiative embraced by a company in the leveraging of innovation and tradition. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={From farm to fork, food supply chains threaten the environment in a range of different ways. Stakeholders in food chains seeking to go green have a twofold problem, comprising limited resources and too many eco-options to choose from. Hence, this study aims to narrow the field of such options, based on a careful assessment of past successful choices when going green. Specifically, it utilizes business analytics to derive insights on food supply chains’ environmental sustainability from numerous data sources, and transforms this intricate information into managerial knowledge of food supply chains in general, and sustainable food supply chains in particular. The analytical results reveal eight crucial characteristics of sustainable food supply chains: devices/software, eco-innovation, organizational culture, warehousing, transportation, food loss/waste, equipment, and regulation. Among these, the two most important drivers of successful sustainability implementation are found to be eco-innovation and food loss/waste. Lastly, this study applies relational view theory and natural resource based view theory to the analytical results to create new sustainable food chain strategies and to extend the application of those theories to sustainable food chain management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Strategic management requires an assessment of a firm's internal and external environments. Our work extends the body of management tools (e.g., SWOT analysis or growth-share matrix) by proposing an automated text mining framework. Here we draw on narrative materials from firms (e.g., financial disclosures) and perform topic modeling so as to identify the key issues faced by an organization. We then quantify the use of language along two dimensions: risk and optimism. This reveals a firm's strengths and weaknesses by identifying business units, activities, and processes subject to risk, while also comparing it with competitors or the market. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Business analytics systems can potentially contribute to firm performance and create competitive advantage. However, these benefits do not always follow from investment in business analytics technology. This paper argues that dynamic capabilities, enabled by business analytics technology, lead to value-creating actions and ultimately to improved firm performance. We develop a theoretical model that explains how organizational strategy relates to both business analytics technology and organizational structure, and impacts value-creating actions. We use the theoretical model to explain the implementation of a CRM system for one type of strategy.},

abstract={Agriculture is a complex industry based on science. Agriculture relies on systems of climate-standard analysis: solar energy, heat, moist and systems for the area of field operation patterns: soil chemical composition, plant nutrition, genetic improvement, pest and disease control, harvesting. We believe that the new paradigm to increase efficiency in this segment goes through the adoption of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Our empirical study is about the use and diffusion of ERP systems in a view of interoperability between different software packages with a view on business analysis functionality when taking a step further in farm management information system (FMIS). We hope this work can bring a theoretical and practical contribution for the agribusiness field and also increase debates about the platforms on cloud computer based on ERP, Enterprise 2.0 and Industry 4.0. The research presented in this study was carried out with 375 farmers in Brazil. The data gathering instrument used for the quantitative research was built based on the result of the qualitative (in-depth) study in combination with three theories: Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOE), Technology-Organization-Environment Framework (TOE), and Inter-organizational Relations (IOR). The construct information sharing (IS) taken from IOR was applied to perform a moderator role on the measurement of ERP adoption stages. The results indicate the significant drivers for evaluation, adoption, and routinisation. Also, as a result, it was found that Information Sharing influence the relationship between evaluation and adoption positively. Moreover, the theoretical and managerial implications of the research results are also debated in the paper. © 2018},

abstract={Business analytics (BA) systems create value and provide competitive advantage for organisations. They involve technology and data infrastructure, BA capabilities and business processes that provide useful insights and support decision-making. To provide value and competitive advantage, BA capabilities should be valuable, rare and inimitable, and have organisational support (VRIO). In this paper, we develop and evaluate a prototype dashboard for the VRIO assessment of BA capabilities. The dashboard is intended to support the strategic management of BA capabilities. We discuss implications of the prototype dashboard for researchers and practitioners and suggest directions for future research. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Business analytics systems can potentially create value and provide competitive advantage to organisations. We argue that business analytics systems can also enable alignment between business strategy and IT strategy and support organisational transformation. We explain how a data warehouse, standardised metrics and global reporting supported the strategic transformation of a diversified and multi-layered international mining company to a unified and integrated global organisation. We identify a number of factors critical to the success of the business analytics initiative and to strategic alignment and organisational transformation, including: the early definition of globally standard metrics and dimensions; a high quality technology infrastructure and high quality data; sustained senior management support together with strong leadership within the business analytics project; effective governance structures that support change management and continual renewal of business analytics capabilities; and hybrid people with a mix of technical, business and strong communication skills. A number of implications of the study are discussed and suggestions for future work are provided.},

abstract={Due to the growth of data volumes, volatility and variety, business analytics (BA) become an essential driver of today's business strategies. However, BA is mainly adopted by large enterprises because it may require a complex and costly infrastructure. As many companies strive to make better use of their data and to adopt data-driven management paradigms, cloud computing has been discussed as a cost-effective approach to BA implementation challenges. To date, there has been little attention on the emerging class of analytical cloud services, “Analytics as a service” (AaaS). This article aims at demarcating AaaS as a cloud offering through an explorative research approach based on multiple case studies. Based on the analysis of 28 AaaS offerings, we derive a classification scheme for AaaS business model configurations and derive five business model archetypes. We discuss cloud computing's implications on the business analytics ecosystem where partner networks play an important role at all levels. By clarifying the definition and characteristics of AaaS business models, our study contributes to the ‘Theory for Analyzing' that lays the groundwork for future research. © 2017 Proceedings of the 25th European Conference on Information Systems, ECIS 2017.

abstract={Purpose: Business analytics (BA) has attracted growing attention mainly due to the phenomena of big data. While studies suggest that BA positively affects organizational performance, there is a lack of academic research. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to examine the extent to which top- and bottom-performing companies differ regarding their use and organizational facilitation of BA. Design/methodology/approach: Hypotheses are developed drawing on the information processing view and contingency theory, and tested using multivariate analysis of variance to analyze data collected from 117 UK manufacture companies. Findings: Top- and bottom-performing companies differ significantly in their use of BA, data-driven environment, and level of fit between BA and data-drain environment. Practical implications: Extensive use of BA and data-driven decisions will lead to superior firm performance. Companies wishing to use BA to improve decision making and performance need to develop relevant analytical strategy to guide BA activities and design its structure and business processes to embed BA activities. Originality/value: This study provides useful management insights into the effective use of BA for improving organizational performance. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The paper investigates the relationship between analytical capabilities in the plan, source, make and deliver area of the supply chain and its performance. The effects of analytics on different maturity levels are analyzed with various statistical techniques. A sample of 788 companies from the USA, Europe, Canada, Brazil and China was used. The results indicate the changing impact of business analytics use on performance, meaning that companies on different maturity levels should focus on different areas. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are thoroughly discussed. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={This chapter introduces the role of Business Analytics (BA) in Performance Management (PM), thus explaining the theoretical and practical concepts of BA, Performance Management Analytics (PMA), and organizational performance; the overview of performance measurement and PM; the application of Performance Management System (PMS) through BA; and the significance of BA in PMA. This chapter also explains the practical areas of BA and their advantages within the foundation of PM. BA can be used to validate causal relationships within traditional input, process, output, and outcome categories toward business success. Extending the domain of PM to PMA requires new business data analysis skills to gain organizational effectiveness. PMA fills the existing gap between PMS and effective PM adoption. Understanding the role of BA in PM will significantly enhance the organizational performance and achieve business goals in the global business environments. © 2015 by IGI Global.

abstract={This paper focuses on the educational research/knowledge management problem of sharing and reuse of teaching practices in an emerging business analytics discipline. Our research context is the Teradata University Network (TUN) community - the leading worldwide community of university and industry members in the field of business intelligence/business analytics. This research aims to investigate the following research question: "How to support and improve knowledge sharing and cocreation of innovative teaching practices in the TUN community?" The paper describes a three-level model of knowledge repository, consisting of (i) instructional resources, (ii) domain-specific learning designs, and (iii) instructional design patterns. In combination, these layers enable design, reuse and sharing of innovative teaching practices, as illustrated in the paper. In addition to making research contributions to educational research and research-led teaching in business analytics, this project also aims to contribute to teaching practice, by improving the current knowledge sharing and reuse of innovative practices. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper looks at a case study of an Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP) implementation in a geographically dispersed utility company and the approach by middle management to several problems perceived by them to be problematic. Their approach was to develop systems outside the implemented ERP. These are referred to as feral systems and the implication of these in terms of effective business analytics (BA) are discussed. The paper contends that despite the extremely effective databases and sophisticated modules for business analytic functions within most ERP's, middle managers are still in the "just in case of an incident" mode of inventory management and data entered in their own feral systems may be significantly different to the inventory levels recorded in the main ERP. The implications to accurate forecasts from BA modules are also discussed. © 2008 Don Kerr and Luke Houghton.},

abstract={The manufacturing sector is under constant pressure to increase profitability in a growingly competitive international market in which differentiation is not tied to manufactured products or utilized technologies but to business processes optimization. In this context, business analytics offer the opportunity to harness the knowledge and value hidden within enterprise information systems to revolutionize innovation, enhance supply chain management and production, accurately target marketing and sales efforts, as well as develop and manage profitable after-sales services. While the literature to date presents numerous specific applications in which business analytics techniques were successfully deployed to improve specific business units, it is evident that a comprehensive enterprise approach is missing. In the present work, a pathway to attain market leadership through the effective use of business analytics is defined suggesting focus must center on three increasingly challenging barriers. Firstly, “standardization” of collection, aggregation and storage of data must be accomplished. Then, an “organizational culture evolution” that outgrows intuition and embraces data-driven decision-making is needed to create the perfect ecosystem for business analytics to produce actionable results and recommendations. In turn, these must guide “business model innovation” efforts to tackle new value creation, and capture and secure market leadership. © 2019},

abstract={Data recording and storage have evolved over the past decades from manual gathering of data by using simple writing materials to the automation of data collection. Data storage has evolved significantly in the past decades and today databases no longer suffice as the only medium for the storage and management of data. This is due to the emergence of the Big Data and Data Science concepts. Previous studies have indicated that the multiplication of processing power of computers and the availability of larger data storage at reduced cost are part of the catalysts for the volume and rate at which data is now made available and captured. In this paper, the concepts of Big Data, Data Science and Business Analytics are reviewed. This paper discusses datafication of different aspects of life as the fundamental concept behind the growth of Big Data and Data Science. A review of the characteristics and value of Big Data and Data Science suggests that these emerging concepts will bring a paradigm change to a number of areas. Big Data was described as the basis for Data Science and Business Analytics which are tools employed in Data Science. Because these fields are still developing, there are diverse opinions, especially on the definition of Data Science. This paper provides a revised definition of Data Science, based on the review of available literature and proposes a schematic representation of the concepts.},

abstract={Purpose: In recent years, the rise of big data has led to an obvious shift in the competence profile expected from the controller and management accountant (MA). Among others, business analytics competences and information technology skills are considered a “must have” capability for the controlling and MA profession. As it still remains unclear if these requirements can be fulfilled by today’s employees, the purpose of this study is to examine the supply of business analytics competences in the current competence profiles of controlling professionals in an attempt to answer the question whether or not a skills gap exists. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a set of 2,331 member profiles of German controlling professionals extracted from the business social network XING, a text analytics approach is conducted to discover patterns out of the semi-structured data. In doing so, the second purpose of this study is to encourage researchers and practitioners to integrate and advance big data analytics as a method of inquiry into their research process. Findings: Apart from the mediating role of gender, company size and other variables, the results indicate that the current competence profiles of the controller do not comply with the recent requirements towards business analytics competences. However, the answer to the question whether a skills gap exist must be made cautiously by taking into account the specific organizational context such as level of IT adoption or the degree of job specialization. Research limitations/implications: Guided by the resource-based view of the firm, organizational theory and social cognitive theory, an explanatory model is developed that helps to explain the apparent skills gap, and thus, to enhance the understanding towards the rationales behind the observed findings. One major limitation to be mentioned is that the data sample integrated into this study is restricted to member profiles of German controlling professionals from foremost large companies. Originality/value: The insights provided in this study extend the ongoing debate in accounting literature and business media on the skills changes of the controlling and MA profession in the big data era. The originality of this study lies in its explicit attempt to integrate recent advances in data analytics to explore the self-reported competence supplies of controlling professionals based on a comprehensive set of semi-structured data. A theoretically founded explanatory model is proposed that integrates empirically validated findings from extant research across various disciplines. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={How can we use synergy to explain the value created by business analytics systems? In this article, we conceptualize and operationalize two important aspects of synergy: namely, the synergistic relationship and the synergistic outcome. We explore the enablers and mechanisms that are involved in a synergistic relationship between business analytics systems and customer relationship management systems and define it as the ability of systems to work together, span their boundaries and complement each other. Synergistic outcomes are the new business analytics–enabled customer relationship management systems that emerge from the synergistic relationship between business analytics systems and customer relationship management systems. Taking a whole system perspective, business analytics–enabled customer relationship management systems comprise the components and the emergent properties that arise from their interaction (e.g. the ability to cross-sell and up-sell based on advanced computational methods), in which the emergent properties are new because they do not exist in the individual components. We develop a research model that uses Synergistic Relationship and Synergistic Outcomes to explain the business value created by business analytics systems and customer relationship management systems, and we test this model using a survey of 201 managers in Australia and the United States. We find that the synergistic relationship plays a significant role in the creation of business analytics–enabled customer relationship management systems and subsequently business value. Business analytics–enabled customer relationship management systems—comprising business analytics systems, customer relationship management systems and their emergent properties—contribute to transactional, informational and strategic value. This goes beyond the value created by the business analytics and customer relationship management systems individually, as measured through statistical interaction. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2019.},

abstract={Measuring and managing the financial sustainability of the borrowers is crucial to financial institutions for their risk management. As a result, building an effective corporate financial distress prediction model has been an important research topic for a long time. Recently, researchers are exerting themselves to improve the accuracy of financial distress prediction models by applying various business analytics approaches including statistical and artificial intelligence methods. Among them, support vector machines (SVMs) are becoming popular. SVMs require only small training samples and have little possibility of overfitting if model parameters are properly tuned. Nonetheless, SVMs generally show high prediction accuracy since it can deal with complex nonlinear patterns. Despite of these advantages, SVMs are often criticized because their architectural factors are determined by heuristics, such as the parameters of a kernel function and the subsets of appropriate features and instances. In this study, we propose globally optimized SVMs, denoted by GOSVM, a novel hybrid SVM model designed to optimize feature selection, instance selection, and kernel parameters altogether. This study introduces genetic algorithm (GA) in order to simultaneously optimize multiple heterogeneous design factors of SVMs. Our study applies the proposed model to the real-world case for predicting financial distress. Experiments show that the proposed model significantly improves the prediction accuracy of conventional SVMs. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to identify, discuss and provide suggestions for how the phenomenon of business analytics and its elements may influence management accounting and the accountant. Design/methodology/approach: This paper not only identifies a number of studies from academic journals but also reports from professional consultancies and professional accounting bodies concerning future opportunities and implications for management accounting in combination with business analytics. Findings: First, it was found that both academic articles and professional accounting bodies suggest changes for management accounting. Second, it shows that topics such holistic views, fact-based decisions, predictions, visualization and specific hard core skills are the most important for the accountant. Finally, the paper demonstrates that there are different ambition levels for the management accountant, depending on if s(he) wants to be on a descriptive, on a predictive or on a prescriptive level. Originality/value: Even though the paper is general in nature, the paper discusses a phenomenon that for some reason has been ignored by practitioners and researchers. The true value of the paper therefore lies in making practitioners and researchers more aware of the possibilities of business analytics for management accounting, and through that, making the management accountant a real value driver for the company. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Business analytics (BA) is increasingly being utilised by radiology departments to analyse and present data. It encompasses statistical analysis, forecasting and predictive modelling and is used as an umbrella term for decision support and business intelligence systems. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether utilising BA technologies could contribute towards improved decision support and resource management within radiology departments. A set of information technology requirements were identified with key stakeholders, and a prototype BA software tool was designed, developed and implemented. A qualitative evaluation of the tool was carried out through a series of semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders. Feedback was collated, and emergent themes were identified. The results indicated that BA software applications can provide visibility of radiology performance data across all time horizons. The study demonstrated that the tool could potentially assist with improving operational efficiencies and management of radiology resources. © 2016, Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.},

abstract={With the emergence of information and communication technologies, organizations worldwide have been putting in meaningful efforts towards developing and gaining business insights by combining technology capability, management capability and personnel capability to explore data potential, which is known as big data analytics (BDA) capability. In this context, variables such as sensing capability—which is related to the organization’s ability to explore the market and develop opportunities—and analytics culture—which refers to the organization’s practices and behavior patterns of its analytical principles—play a fundamental role in BDA initiatives.However, there is a considerable literature gap concerning the effects of BDA-enabled sensing capability and analytics culture on organizational outcomes (i.e., customer linking capability, financial performance, market performance, and strategic business value) and on how important the organization’s analytics culture is as a mediator in the relationship between BDA-enabled sensing capability and organizational outcomes.Therefore, this study aims to investigate these relationships. And to attain this goal, we developed a conceptual model supported by dynamics capabilities, BDA, and analytics culture. We then validated our model by applying partial least squares structural equation modeling. The findings showed not only the positive effect of the BDA-enabled sensing capability and analytics culture on organizational outcomes but also the mediation effect of the analytics culture. Such results bring valuable theoretical implications and contributions to managers and practitioners. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Purpose: The survival and growth of organizations presently depend on managing processes and capabilities to effectively use large volumes of data from different sources to assist organizations’ strategic and operational goals. This paper aims to test the relationship between organizational analytical capabilities (OAC), the performance results in organizational resilience (OR) and the business process management maturity (BPMM). Design/methodology/approach: Based on a survey of companies operating in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil, a conceptual model was proposed and tested using the partial least squares algorithm. Findings: The results confirm the proposed theoretical hypotheses that OAC and BPMM positively impact OR. In addition, the results show that OAC exert a moderating effect on the relationship between BPMM and OR. Practical implications: It is understood that stimulating the practice of data and information analysis in the organizational routine translates into a relevant managerial behavior, as this attitude leverages the knowledge development and understanding about how to manage unexpected risk events, enabling companies to assess their ability to react to disruptions, even in terms of operational failures. © 2018, Larissa Alves Sincorá, Marcos Paulo Valadares de Oliveira, Hélio Zanquetto-Filho and Marcelo Bronzo Ladeira.},

abstract={Purpose: The study aims to provide insights in the sensemaking process and the use of business analytics (BA) for project selection and prioritisation in start-up settings. A major focus is on the various ways start-ups can understand their data through the analytical process of sensemaking. Design/methodology/approach: This is a comparative case study of two start-ups that use BA in their projects. The authors follow an interpretive approach and draw from the constructivist grounded theory method (GTM) for the purpose of data analysis, whereby the theory of sensemaking functions as the sensitising device that supports the interpretation of the data. Findings: The key findings lie within the scope of project selection and prioritisation, where the sensemaking process is implicitly influenced by each start-up's strategy and business model. BA helps start-ups notice changes within their internal and external environment and focus their attention on the more critical questions along the lines of their processes, operations and business model. However, BA alone cannot support decision-making around less structured problems such as project selection and prioritisation, where intuitive judgement and personal opinion are still heavily used. Originality/value: This study extends the research on BA applied in organisations as tools for business development. Specifically, the authors draw on the literature of BA tools in support of project management from multiple perspectives. The perspectives include but are not limited to project assessment and prioritisation. The authors view the decision-making process and the path from insight to value, as a sensemaking process, where data become part of the sensemaking roadmap and BA helps start-ups navigate the decision-making process. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Their clientele includes major financial institutions, international corporations, consulting companies and smaller retail businesses. While most of their clients have been with them for a while, their work is typically project based, which entails increased needs for project management, monitoring and costing. It also means that, despite their best efforts to streamline their processes and offer predefined B2B solutions through their platform, for the most part, their services and reporting is mostly ad hoc and tailor made for each project.

abstract={Purpose: The private health care sector is seeking to improve their understanding of business processes to be able to improve their performance. The purpose of this paper is to understand the future needs of the private health care sector organizations in terms of business intelligence (BI) and business analytics (BA) to ensure value creation. Design/methodology/approach: The four evolution stages of intellectual capital enriched by managerial data-driven approach are used as a framework to point out the future of BI or BA in the private healthcare sector. The research includes private health care organizations, BI vendors and management consultants in Finland. Findings: Based on the findings, the private health care is stepping towards a new phase of data-driven decision-making, requiring to change the whole set of mind towards use of data and required capabilities. Moreover, it shows that the future factors of BI varied from practical tools and methods such as predictive and prescriptive analytics along with AI, to more conceptual factors such as social BI co-creation and platforms. Practical implications: As an outcome, this study provides an understanding of the role of IC components in the future BI and use of BA as well as provides a valuable insight into the future potential of BI in the private health care sector. Originality/value: Data-driven decision-making and seeking for new business opportunities are currently one of the most discussed topics in the private health care sector. By identifying the future opportunities of BI and BA, this study provides a better understanding of the role of IC components and BI in creating potential for new business for private health care. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This article discusses the importance of a sufficient body of knowledge about databases for MBA business analytics students. It presents the pedagogical design and the teaching method of a module of database-centric OLAP (online analytical process) for an MBA business analytics course when a standalone database course is infeasible for the MBA business analytics program. The teaching module includes key database concepts for business analytics, a tutorial on database-centric OLAP, and a database-centric OLAP exercise assignment. The teaching module demands about a half-credit-hour workload and can be embedded in a three-credit-hour MBA business analytics course. © ISCAP-Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals.},

abstract={We develop techniques for mining labor records from a large number of historical IT consulting projects in order to discover clusters of projects exhibiting similar resource usage over the project life-cycle. The clustering results, together with domain expertise, are used to build a meaningful project taxonomy that can be linked to project resource requirements. Such a linkage is essential for project-based workforce demand forecasting, a key input for more advanced workforce management decision support. We formulate the problem as a sequence clustering problem where each sequence represents a project and each observation in the sequence represents the weekly distribution of project labor hours across job role categories. To solve the problem, we use a model-based clustering algorithm based on explicit state duration left-right hidden semi-Markov models (HsMM) capable of handling high-dimensional, sparse, and noisy Dirichlet-distributed observations and sequences of widely varying lengths. We then present an approach for using the underlying cluster models to estimate future staffing needs. The approach is applied to a set of 250 IT consulting projects and the results discussed. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: The emergence of the knowledge economy and Industry 4.0 has prompted many firms to invest considerable resources into knowledge-based human resource management (HRM) practices and business analytics capabilities aimed at enhancing competitiveness. This paper aims to propose a conceptual model that examines the collective effects of knowledge-based HRM practices, business analytics capabilities and organizational agility on innovative performance using knowledge-based theory as a theoretical framework. Design/methodology/approach: The present study empirically tested the above-said idea by surveying (n = 182) individuals with supervisory capacity in Jordanian 4- and 5-star hotels. The obtained data was analyzed using linear modeling and fuzzy sets (fsQCA) techniques. Findings: Results from linear modeling revealed that knowledge-based HRM practices, business analytics and organizational agility are important antecedents for innovative performance. Conversely, findings from fsQCA revealed that organizational agility is a necessary and sufficient condition to achieve high innovative performance. While business analytics is a sufficient condition to achieve high innovative performance. Originality/value: This study is among the first to unveil the linear and complimentary effects of knowledge-based HRM practices, business analytics capabilities and organizational agility on innovative performance. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social media (SM) platforms greatly facilitate business information sharing, customer relationship building, and client emotion expression. However, managing knowledge acquired from SM messages is challenged by limited human cognitive capability. This paper describes a computational framework for developing intelligent SM-based business analytics and visualization. The research developed a proof-of-concept system named CyTraSS to support intelligent analyses and visualization of 2,318,691 messages posted by 740,070 users who discuss trafficking topics on Twitter. The results demonstrate theoretical insights and practical usability of the framework, enhance understanding of knowledge creation with SM technology, and provide novel findings for business managers and policy makers. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The process of information security risk management (ISRM) enables an organization to not only identify risks specific to its information and assets, but also to assess the impact and likelihood of a threat occurrence. Despite significant interest and investment in ISRM, its organizational practice still has deficiencies since it is not considered a standard management process of an organization and lacks evidence based decision making. Business analytics (BA) presents organizations with a unique opportunity to base their ISRM upon continuous monitoring and data analysis, thereby helping executives make timely, data driven security decisions in a proactive manner. In this research in progress paper, we utilize Resource-based Theory (RBT) to develop a research model that explains how interaction between the capabilities of security analytics and ISRM results in the development of an enhanced, high level analytics enabled ISRM. This in turn impacts overall security performance. We define the model based on an extensive analysis of the BA and ISRM literature. The model also provides a basis for future empirical work including focus groups, case studies and a survey.},

abstract={In recent years, supply chain performance measurement has received much attention from researchers and practitioners. Effective supply chain performance through supply chain antecedents such as business analytics has become a potentially valuable way of securing competitive advantage and improving supply chain performance. Many organizations have begun to recognize that supply chain management is the key to building a sustainable competitive advantage for their products or services in an increasingly crowded marketplace. Despite the fact that, determining supply chain performance through its antecedents is considered as a unique methodology, theoretical and comprehensive studies on supply chain performance through the methodology is few and far between. This study addressed the lack of the empirical studies by developing a comprehensive model to examine the effect of plan analyse, source analyse, make analyse and delivery analyse on supply chain performance considering moderating effect of WS on the relationships. A quantitative methodology using a cross-sectional survey method was used to investigate the relationship between variables. Data were collected from automotive companies in Iran. The overall response rate was 86.72%. The relationships between variables were examined using structural equation modelling (SEM) technique and partial least squares (PLS) software was used to examine the proposed hypotheses. The results revealed there is a significant and positive relationship between four areas of business analytics namely plan analyse, source analyse, make analyse and delivery analyse and supply chain performance. Moreover, the results indicated that the aforementioned relationship is moderated by WS. The study combined resource- based theory, resource dependence theories to develop a new theoretical framework to demonstrate the importance of the four areas of SCOR approach businesses analytic; in improving supply chain performance.

abstract={This paper deals with people counting in stores for business analytics using stereo vision. Among the several problems in this type of applications, two are the most relevant for our purposes: the management of occlusions and the distinction between adult people (potential customers) and other objects (children, trolleys, strollers, animals, etc.). The proposed solution uses a novel approach for object detection (based on background suppression on a so-called 'depth bird-eye view' and the clustering on the 3D point cloud by means of mean shift with a cylindrical kernel) followed by an adult people classifier which exploits a fitness measure with respect to a cylindrical human body model. The fitness is computed using Montecarlo sampling to estimate the volume occupation. Experiments are conducted on two real setups (including a store in a normal day of activity) and compared with a previous work. The results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed solution. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The continuity strategy of business innovation to deal with the disruption condition, it is still many to be designed and explained. Referring to a sociotechnical systems (STSs) approach, this article conceptualizes and practically examines the business analytics, virtual business, and knowledge absorptive capacity that increase and produce the continuity capability of business innovation in uncertain business environment (e.g., COVID-19). We used SmartPLS to empirically evaluate the model based on 145 companies in a developing country of Indonesia that is currently under high disruption. Drawing a technical perspective, business analytics has successfully enhanced business continuity innovation and knowledge absorptive capacity. In a socio perspective, knowledge absorptive capacity significantly produces business continuity innovation. Business continuity innovation suffers if firms adopt virtual business without increasing their knowledge capabilities. Furthermore, mediating effects present higher support from management level to knowledge absorptive capacity strategy, a bigger impact for business analytics, and virtual business to improve and increase the goals opportunities of business continuity innovation. A novel contribution is the integration of STSs (business analytics, virtual business, and knowledge absorptive capacity) that drives business continuity innovation to deal and recover from uncertain environment. Our efforts also align several fields such as information technology-business alignment strategy, knowledge management, and knowledge-business services. Future research would be worthwhile and interesting whether our framework will suitable to different companies&#x002F;respondents, business context, industry area, and crisis condition. IEEE},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this article is to identify how the organisations are able to improve their business value through acquisition of business analytics capabilities and by improving their performance. Design/methodology/approach: With the help of literature survey, along with standard resource-based view framework, a conceptual model has been developed. These have been statistically tested by collecting the data using the survey questionnaire from 306 selected respondents from various service sector- and product-based organisations in India. To analyse the data we have used partial least square–based structural equation modelling. Findings: The study highlights that by the help of data acquisition and tool acquisition as two vital components the acquisition of business analytics capabilities could improve the business value of the organisation by strengthening its organisational performance. The findings of this research also indicated that acquisition of business analytics capabilities has a significant influence on an organisation's business process performance and business decision, which in turn significantly influences organisational performance. And organisational performance eventually positively influences its business value. The model was found to provide an explanative power of 71%. Research limitations/implications: The proposed research model can provide effective recommendations to the management of the organisations to realise the importance of acquisition of effective business analytics capabilities to eventually improve the business value of the organisation. Originality/value: No specific studies, as yet, have analysed the effects of acquisition of business analytics capabilities for improving organisational performance mediated through business process performance and business decision. Therefore, this research has explored the distinctive effort to empirically validate this understanding. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Network operations often suffer from chronic asset imbalance over time and across locations. This paper addresses the issue in the intermodal industry. The problem is mainly driven by myopic policies, environmental uncertainty, and network interdependence. To address the problem, we develop a unified framework that integrates two core operations: container repositioning and load acceptance. The central piece is the scarcity pricing scheme, which internalizes the externalities each acceptance imposes over time and across locations. The scheme plays two crucial roles: to transmit dynamic scarcity information and to incentivize container repositioning. It is most effective when network imbalance and supply risk are high. Exploiting random capacity and heterogeneous lead time, we further refine the load acceptance policy and develop efficient algorithms. We demonstrate that our approach can dynamically reduce network imbalance and improve efficiency. As such, our work provides analytical tools and insights on how to manage network capacity, when the information is dispersed and evolving over time. © 2019 INFORMS.},

abstract={Business analytics (BA) is an important organisational activity and research discipline. However, history has shown that information systems (IS)-related disciplines with promising futures do not always flourish as expected. The troubled history of one such discipline (i.e., operations research/management science, or OR/MS) serves as a cautionary tale for the BA community because it warns of the dangers of an unquestioning faith in the power of mathematical modelling and analysis. This cautionary tale is especially alarming given the methodological similarities between BA and OR/MS, as well as the sizeable investments organisations have made in their BA capabilities. It is, therefore, appropriate and prudent to ask if a similar fate could befall BA and how such a fate can be avoided. Those questions are addressed in this article by extracting “lessons learned” from the OR/MS literature and applying them to BA. The lessons highlight opportunities and challenges to BA which are then framed within a widely cited research agenda. Theoretical propositions are forwarded to encourage research that can help promote the future of BA–both as an organisational practice and research stream–through a wider, broad-based, and balanced critical discourse among scholars and practitioners. © 2019, © The Operational Research Society 2019.},

Three new proposed DEA models are presented. The results obtained provide credible data analytics and intelligent business suggestions. Firstly the proposed input oriented and the proposed output oriented DEA models are formulated. The proposed input oriented DEA model suggests how resource utilization can be minimized while operating in with the same output level. Further, the proposed output oriented model suggests how output efficiency can be increased to a benchmark level while keeping the input at the same level. Then the proposed Slack Based DEA model SBM is formulated. The proposed models are then solved with the DEA Excel Solver for finding the efficient points in the Pareto Frontier. Representing the Pareto Frontier as a function of total system revenue gives necessary information about the inputs growth and their trade-off with the output. Furthermore, the proposed Slack Based DEA model (SBM) intelligently measures the technical efficiency of each airline. The results show that three airlines namely American, United and Jet Blue are weakly efficient operating below the proposed SBM efficient frontier. Furthermore, the results intelligently suggest the possible inputs reduction and outputs increases to get to the efficient frontier for the management of the concerned airlines. The proposed SBM slacks suggest the possible areas of improvement for future planning and optimal operating input/output levels for the top management of the weakly efficient airlines. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={A decision-support, modeling tool is developed that can project future cattle growth patterns in a feedlot based on a low dimensionality dataset available at the start of the feeding process. This work adapts the predictive performance of two well-known statistical machine modeling tools, gradient boosting and random forest regression, to predict future cattle growth. Time series analysis techniques are then used to create an ensemble method that further improves prediction accuracy from individual modeling outputs. Hierarchical clustering techniques are used to leverage projected growth patterns to increase group homogeneity when assigning cattle to different feeding pens. Finally, a profit maximization method is developed that estimates the optimal time each individual cattle should remain in the system under different revenue and cost estimates. The purpose of this work is to incentivize the implementation of modern statistical learning tools in cattle management operations, especially within low-to-mid scale operations that traditionally rely on the expertise of its workers and have limited cattle and process information. Access to ‘off-the-shelf’ statistical learning tools, requiring minimal user-interaction, not only enhances prediction accuracy but helps automate operational decisions. This results in higher process efficiencies and improved standardization practices, while also helping identify profit opportunities. Finally, integrating these components into a single operating framework allows the tool to adapt to changes in data characteristics, which is especially important within non-standardized processes. We show the application of this tool through a case study implementation on a mid-scale operation in the northwestern state of Sonora, Mexico. From our case-study results, it was found that the modeling tool can satisfactorily predict growth patterns based on a low-dimensional set. It also can also capture historic decision-making when segmenting cattle into homogenous groups during their feeding process. Furthermore, it can help identify profit opportunities when estimating optimal cattle system times under varying market conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Kolon Sport (K/S), a leading outdoor fashion brand in South Korea, must deal with a large variety of items during each selling season. In doing so, the company has encountered a challenging operational problem-the assort-packing and distribution problem. The problem involves making decisions on the optimal method to use in packing a set of different items in a box and allocating the boxes to stores to meet the stores' demands. In this paper, we introduce an analytics project initiated to improve the assortpacking and distribution process, and we describe the formulation and solution approach we developed to solve this industrial problem in a timely manner. We validated the proposed approach by computational and onsite pilot testing, which demonstrated that the decisions made using this approach are superior to those made with the manual method K/S used previously. Inventory is distributed to all stores in a more balanced way by considering the demands of the stores. K/S, which implemented the proposed approach into its internal system in July 2015, estimates that the new system improves sales by approximately eight percent. © 2017 INFORMS.},

abstract={Business analytics is an important means of gaining new insights and understanding of business performance. Data mining technology provides information needed by business analytics based on data. But due to the barriers of skill, resource and cost, business analytics is hard to carry out and put into practice for small and even medium sized enterprises. This paper presents a novel concept named Highly Consumable Business Analytics (HCBA) aiming to improve consumability of business analytics. We discuss the ways to simplify the use of data mining algorithms, establish end-to-end integrated lifecycle management of model and ultimately wrap models into web service to provide model-wise services. We propose a general reference architecture of HCBA. And a prototype is designed and implemented based on this architecture. © 2016 IEEE.},

The collection and analysis of this data will allow for the application of advanced data analytics techniques that will lead to a better understanding and evaluation of the economic and best management practices for commercial beekeepers and growers of pollinated crops. This paper describes the process through which data was collected from hobbyist, sideliner, and commercial beekeepers in the form of inspection and checklist forms that are currently being used to perform hive inspections across the US. Recruiting a community of “citizen scientists” to input hive health data from inspections creates a database of best management practices that can be used universally in monitoring hive health. In standardizing the data gained from beekeepers, we can gather best management practices to enhance the solvency of technology in improving hive health. © 2017 AIS/ICIS Administrative Office.

abstract={Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools and technologies are revolutionizing enterprise workflow and processes. Deployment of ICT tools for supply chain planning and execution has resulted in greater agility, robustness, collaboration, visibility and seamless integration of all stakeholders in the enterprise and also extended enterprise consisting of suppliers and customers. Business analytics is emerging as a potent tool for enterprises to improve their profitability and competitive edge. Business analytics aims at building fresh perspectives and new insights into business performance using data, statistical methods, quantitative analysis and predictive modeling. Advanced analytics is being employed for several processes in supply chain planning and execution like demand forecasting, inventory management, production & distribution planning etc. Enterprise case studies of successful deployments of business analytics for supply chain management are showcased. Some challenges faced in business analytics usage like high cost, need for data aggregation from multiple sources etc are also highlighted. An integration of business analytics with disruptive and game-changing technologies like social media, cloud computing and mobile technologies in the form of the SMAC - Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud stack holds tremendous promise to be the next wave in enterprise computing with wideranging advantages like improved supply chain planning, collaboration, execution and stake-holder engagement. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={The industry for business analytics within the BI sphere is growing significantly and the distinction in organizations between transactional information systems and decision-oriented systems breaks down. Firms need to understand both the opportunity and the potential of business analytics. Reporting, which is getting a handle on what happened in organizations, is complemented by analytics that is rather explanatory and predictive. Leveraging business analytics means to use analytics applications in order to analyse business problems and produce related business recommendations to improve business process performance. Business analytics must but be a part of a value creating process operating together with other systems and organisational factors in a synergistic manner, including people, processes, knowledge and relationship assets, culture, structure, and policies. In order for companies to be efficient, they need to automate processes, workflows and make rules. Effectiveness, on the other hand, is about making better decisions, perhaps using the same data that their competitors may have. What matters is not necessarily the technologies deployed, but emerging competence that the firm uses to support its business. A specific "mindset" needs to be installed for companies to invest into business analytics. Organisations need to better understand how best to exploit their data and convert them into information and sense-making capabilities. Business capabilities can be enhanced not only by exploitation of analytical tools, but also by the sophisticated use of information. This leads to a truly sense-making capability or "analytical mindset". The primary data covers 398 data sets, where firms have been asked about the specifics of their information management. The data is used as input to statistical tests and the value of business analytics is being analyzed in an empirical way.},

abstract={This study analytically examines online promotions with gift rewards based on data from a Chinese tea retailer, Huiliu. Gift rewards benefit Huiliu by improving promotional performance. However, they generate operational problems, especially by increasing the costs of holding gift inventory. To address Huiliu’s concerns about gift rewards, we first conduct an empirical study based on Huiliu’s promotional data to examine the effect of gift rewards on customer purchase behavior. The empirical result suggests that gift rewards induce more repeat customer purchases; however, they do not induce customers to spend more money. This empirical result reveals that the effect of gift rewards on customer purchase behavior leads to Huiliu’s intensifying gift inventory pressure. Based on this empirical finding, we develop a theoretical model that addresses gift inventory management. Because of the difficulty of precisely estimating the distributions of some key random variables (e.g., customer demands), we employ a robust approach to solve this model and provide near-optimal robust solutions. We finally present a case study to illustrate how to improve Huiliu’s gift allocation based on the robust inventory solutions. The numerical results show that the improved gift allocation significantly increases Huiliu’s profits (the average profit increment is 3.58%). © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Business analytics is a management tool for achieving significant business performance improvements. Many organizations fail to or only partially achieve their business objectives and goals from business analytics. Business analytics adoption is a multi-stage complex activity consisting of evaluation, adoption, and assimilation stages. Several research papers have been published in the field of business analytics, but the research on multi-stage BA adoption is fewer in number. This study contributes to the scant literature on the multi-stage adoption model by identifying the critical themes for evaluation, adoption, and assimilation stages of business analytics. This study uses the thematic content analysis of peer-reviewed published academic papers as a research technique to explore the key themes of business analytics adoption. This study links the critical themes with the popular theoretical foundations: Resource-Based View (RBV), Dynamic Capabilities, Diffusion of Innovations, and Technology-Organizational-Environmental (TOE) framework. The study identifies twelve major factors categorized into three key themes: organizational characteristics, innovation characteristics, and environmental characteristics. The main organizational factors are top management support, organization data environment, centralized analytics structure, perceived cost, employee skills, and data-based decision making culture. The major innovation characteristics are perceived benefits, complexity, and compatibility, and information technology assets. The environmental factors influencing BA adoption stages are competition and industry pressure. A conceptual framework for the multi-stage BA adoption model is proposed in this study. The findings of this study can assist the practicing managers in developing a stage-wise operational strategy for business analytics adoption. Future research can also attempt to validate the conceptual model proposed in this study. © 2020 Korean Society of Management Information Systems.},

abstract={Data infrastructure and quality are vital organs influencing the health of any organizations and are essential for creating and delivering business insights. Due to this fact, stakeholders expect a flawless experience, real-time solutions and support. However, these expectations are normally too high for IT departments that are always immersed with various users' requests. The Big Data era and its analytics have put organizations in positions to predict and forecast users' needs to produce a great user experience. This is achieved through intuitive design, error-free coding and quality performance. There is increasing demand for better business analytics so as to enable organizations establish solid foundation by building out a data management ecosystem that delivers flexibility and performance required by cognitive solutions. The objective of this paper was to highlight how universities can leverage better analytics to process amount of continuously generated data from various sources and generate actionable insights needed to achieve academic business goals. This study followed an interpretive paradigm taking a case study of a South African university and employed semi-structured interviews. This study found that data value and the use thereof in the management of academic divisions of the university should be consistent with faculty business plans. In this way, business analytics is not haphazardly used but is strategically aligned with faculty plans and overall institutional strategic objectives and targets. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={It is said that knowledge is power, yet often, decision makers ignore information that ought to be considered. The phenomenon known as Semmelweis reflex occurs when new knowledge is rejected because it contradicts established norms. The goal of evidence-based management (EBMgt) is to help overcome Semmelweis reflex by integrating evaluated external evidence with stakeholder preference, practitioner experiences, and context. This evaluated external evidence is the product of scientific research. In this paper, we demonstrate an EBMgt business analytics model that uses computer simulation to provide scientific evidence to help decision makers evaluate equipment replacement problems, specifically the parallel machine replacement problem. The business analytics application is demonstrated in the form of a fleet management problem for a state transportation agency. The resulting analysis uses real-world data allowing decision makers to unfreeze their current system, move to a new state, and re-freeze a new system. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

abstract={This study proposes a model designed to help sales representatives in the software industry to manage the complex sales pipeline. By integrating business analytics in the form of machine learning into lead and opportunity management, data-driven qualification support reduces the high degree of arbitrariness caused by professional expertise and experiences. Through the case study of a software provider, we developed an artifact consisting of three models to map the end-to-end sales pipeline process using real business data from the company's CRM system. The results show a superiority of the CatBoost and Random Forest algorithm over other supervised classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, and Decision Tree as the baseline. The study also reveals that the probability of either winning or losing a sales deal in the early lead stage is more difficult to predict than analyzing the lead and opportunity phases separately. Furthermore, an explanation functionality for individual predictions is provided. © 2019 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Over the last few years, the number of organisations adopting business analytics (BA) has grown rapidly. Organisations adopt BA to gain better insights on their processes and structures that help them to make more informed business decisions. There are several studies that investigate how BA systems can improve decision-making, create competitive advantage and provide value. Mostly, the focus of these studies have been on the technical aspects of BA and its implementation in areas such as supply chain management, marketing, and finance. However, there is a lack of significant body of literature reporting on the impact of BA adoption on organisations. This study aims to develop a richer understanding of BA capabilities and organisational impact. Information processing theory (IPT) as a theoretical lens is used to investigate this phenomenon. This study will utilise an in-depth case study to provide rich explanations on the impact of BA adoption on organisations. © 2018 ACIS2018.org. All rights reserved.},

abstract={With increasing maturity of analytical software tools, many companies deploy at least basic forms of business analytics to improve data-based decision making. Research about analytics in the field of information systems is currently scarce. While existing work primarily focused on capabilities for successful implementations, no attention has been paid to the role of the IT department. The goal of this paper is to explore and validate different roles of how the IT unit contributes to business value for business analytics. The proposed research model draws from the resource-based view and IT management theory. It provides a comprehensive summary of critical resources that are derived from literature. Preliminary results of case studies with nine CIOs and senior IT executives confirm the presence of four typological profiles for the IT. In a next step, we plan to formulate hypothesizes and empirically validate the model. © 2018 Association for Information Systems. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This chapter introduces the role of Business Analytics (BA) in Performance Management (PM), thus explaining the theoretical and practical concepts of BA, Performance Management Analytics (PMA), and organizational performance; the overview of performance measurement and PM; the application of Performance Management System (PMS) through BA; and the significance of BA in PMA. This chapter also explains the practical areas of BA and their advantages within the foundation of PM. BA can be used to validate causal relationships within traditional input, process, output, and outcome categories toward business success. Extending the domain of PM to PMA requires new business data analysis skills to gain organizational effectiveness. PMA fills the existing gap between PMS and effective PM adoption. Understanding the role of BA in PM will significantly enhance the organizational performance and achieve business goals in the global business environments. © 2017, IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The paper is devoted to the problem of strategic business analytics. The aim of the study is to show business analytics supporting the construction and development of the company development strategy. In order to achieve the assumed goal there has been applied the method of critical analysis of the domestic and foreign literature in the field of business analytics of enterprises domestically and worldwide. In the paper, there have been identified the factors for the use of business analytics. Three priority factors which are the arguments for the application of business analytics in management processes and enterprise development strategies are: speed/ease of deployment (68% of indications), ease of use for business users (65% of indications) and self-service and data discovery tools (61% of indications). Moreover, managers of enterprises with the best economic and financial results, achieving return on assets (ROA) of more than 10%, almost agreeably (90% of indications) claim that analytical tools are necessary for the proper implementation of the strategy and the achievement of increasingly higher economic and financial results. The value of the paper consists in showing a new trend in the development of business analytics, which is to support the process of strategic management and analytical competition. © 2017, Czestochowa University of Technology.

abstract={Assessing the alignment of the quality management dimensions with organisational strategic planning represents a big challenge for firm competitive advantage realisation for the 21st century companies. The main constraints are of essence: time, data reliability and accuracy. This paper aims at tackling this issue and providing a design of a quality management business analytics (QMBA) roadmap. Drawing on firm drivers including: leadership, strategic planning, customer and market focus, measurement, analysis, and knowledge management, human resource focus, process management, and business/organisational performance results, the QMBA will develop a framework where a dashboard will be derived for each working unit within the organisation, and thus an overall dashboard is set for the whole organisation. Subsequently, business analytics will feed each dashboard will real-time access for firm improved decision making.

abstract={Orlando Health has brought its hospital and physician practice revenue cycle systems into better balance using four sets of customized analytics: Physician performance analytics gauge the total net revenue for every employed physician. Patient-pay analytics provide financial risk scores for all patients on both the hospital and physician practice sides. Revenue management analytics bridge the gap between the back-end central business office and front-end physician practice managers and administrators. Enterprise management analytics allow the hospitals and physician practices to share important information about common patients.},

abstract={The majority of enterprises are in the process of recognizing that business data analytics have the potential to transform their daily operations and make them extremely effective at addressing business challenges, identifying new market trends and embracing new ways to engage customers. Such analytics are in most cases related with the processing of data coming from various data sources that include structured and unstructured data. In order to get insight through the analysis results, appropriate input has to be provided that in many cases has to combine data from cross-sectorial and heterogeneous public or private data sources. Thus, there is inherent a need for applying novel techniques in order to harvest complex and heterogeneous datasets, turn them into insights and make decisions. In this paper, we present an approach for the production of added-value business analytics through the consumption of interlinked versions of data and the exploitation of linked data principles. Such interlinked data constitute valuable input for the initiation of an analytics extraction process and can lead to the realization of analysis that was not envisaged in the past. In addition to the production of analytics based on the consumption of linked data, the proposed approach supports the interlinking of the produced results with the associated input data, increasing in this way the value of the produced data and making them discoverable for further use in the future. The designed business analytics and data mining component is described in detail, along with an indicative application scenario combining data from the governmental, societal and health sectors.},

abstract={In Chapter 1, The CAM framework focused on the development of innovative social business models through the usage of frontier data envelopment analysis to measure shared value for a sustainable growth of an organization. Chapter 2 first discusses the causes and effects of societal challenges and how shared value models can alleviate them. Second, successful technology and non-technology innovations for shared-value models are reviewed. Third, guidelines to develop key performance smart indicators, pitfalls traps, and phases of budgeting steps for the design of performance management and measurement systems are discussed. Fourth, big data and business analytics challenges, potentials, models, and tools are presented. Fifth, the essential components for designing a corporate big data strategy are suggested. Finally, new ideas are explained to democratize shared-value knowledge through electronic services to transform loyalty of people from parties, clergies, and dictatorships to society's loyalty to achieve smarter communities in the 21st century. © 2013, IGI Global.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper focuses on the “how” of business analytics (BA) value creation, which remains an open research problem and a practical challenge. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a novel BA value creation mechanism that is BA-enabled improvement of Knowledge-intensive Business Processes (KIBPs), with experiential knowledge of decision makers as the key to a more sustainable BA-enabled competitive differentiation. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses a qualitative research case study, conducted in a large retail distribution company. The research insights were observed through a combined lens of work systems theory and the knowledge-based view (KBV) of the firm, using an interpretive approach. Findings: The proposed theoretical model identifies three stages of KIBP improvement through BA and explains how they lead to a sustainable BA-enabled competitive differentiation. Stage 1 focusses on BA support for individual knowledge-intensive tasks, Stage 2 focusses on individual decision makers and their ability to gain KIBP-related analytical insights and turn them into action; and Stage 3 on sharing of the acquired experiential knowledge amongst decision makers using BA. Originality/value: In addition to proposing a novel mechanism for BA value creation, this research demonstrates the importance of leveraging experiential knowledge of decision makers as a pathway to a more sustainable competitive differentiation through BA. This, in turn, creates new opportunities for knowledge management researchers to engage in BA-related research. It also opens a new approach for BA researchers to investigate BA value creation mechanisms through the lens of KBV, rather than more common resource-based or capability-based views. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Microfinance institutions are social enterprises that focus on the provision of financial services to poor populations excluded from the conventional banking system. These organizations face a double-bottom line, dealing simultaneously with a financial and social objective. The challenge of putting it into action is great, especially when there is a need to involve all stakeholders and to replicate the experience to new communities. One way to sustain both financial performance and social impacts is to develop a business analytics solution aiming at measuring and expanding social impacts in a financially sustainable way. This paper describes main elements to be considered, in particular the organizational context, the development process, and implementation issues that would facilitate or impede the deployment of a business analytics initiative in practice. Finally, two main components of the implementation process are specifically pointed out: a behavioral fit of the business analytics solution to the cultural context of the organization, and the country where it is deployed, and a flexible commitment in the management of the business analytics initiative implementation. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={E-commerce has become an important technological business phenomenon all over the world. This paper aims at investigating e-commerce policy perspectives and business analytics of e-commerce practice statistics. In doing so, it highlights the importance of promoting ethical values in preventing illegal and unauthorized e-commerce practices. The study shows that e-commerce is more than just the purchase and sale of products and services over the internet, but rather a much broader concept of transformations in the way of doing business and communicating with stakeholders. A sound e-commerce strategy should manage the integration between business strategy and information technology strategy. Business analytics of e-commerce worldwide practices statistics and trends reveal that global e-commerce is no longer a choice but rather an inevitable business activity adopting online strategies. Innovative e-commerce infrastructure should incorporate all e-commerce aspects including physical, online, and ethical. Hence, the study has important implications for both businesses and stakeholders promoting the ideology of integrating ethical infrastructure within the mainstream business infrastructure. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of this article is to address the Business Analytics (BA) practice based on the sociomateriality approach within the Revenue Management (RM) context of an airline. The study proposes that BA is an active engagement process which is set between analysts and business managers according to their sociomaterial imbrication with analytical data and tools, which areused to generate new insights. The discussion is substantiated by the theoretical articulation of BA as applied to RM based on the sociomateriality approach, which acknowledges the synergetic interaction between human and material dimensions by keeping their distinction from intentionality. The empirical investigation followed a qualitative design supported by non-participatory observation, interview and document research, which were the data collection techniques. The collected data was analyzed through spiral analysis associated with a practices' description and analyses framework. Results have supported the BA proposition by evidencing the human/material dimension entanglement to produce BA-practice specificities. © 2020 FUCAPE Business School. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Online health infomediaries are emerging as a critical element in the healthcare sector to support and influence individuals’ health and wellness decisions. The business success and effectiveness of health infomediaries depend on the active and sustained engagement of patients. Although the growth in the number of participants in an infomediary is expected to add value by increasing the diversity of information that is potentially exchanged, the infomediary cannot survive without the sustained engagement of existing users. The challenge is to understand the underlying processes at the operational workflow level of an infomediary that can lead to sustained engagement of patients. For an infomediary to increase engagement, it needs to know not only what motivates participants to join an infomediary but also what keeps them engaged in various stages of participation or transitions. In this study, we employ a Markov Chain modeling approach, along with an analysis of the user activities data, to understand the underlying mechanism of patient engagement along with several transition states in an online health infomediary. We tracked 127,610 members, with more than 1 million activities involved in an online health infomediary that supports cosmetic and reconstructive surgery patients over one year. Patients’ decisions for cosmetic and reconstructive surgery are health and well-being choices that rely not only on patients’ current situation but also on the knowledge and experience of others. This relevance of the health infomediary context is explored in this study. We sampled the activities of 32,505 active users’ activities with data on more than 500,000 activities. We analyzed the dynamics of user behaviors by modeling longitudinal transition probabilities across different states of participation. Additional analyses and robustness checks, using text-mined data from the users’ activities, are introduced to gain nuanced insights into user engagement. Our study provides several practical implications for the design and management of an online health infomediary. © 2020 Decision Sciences Institute},

abstract={Objectives: Monitoring healthcare activities is the first step for health stakeholders and health professionals to improve the quality and performance of healthcare services. However, monitoring remains a challenge for healthcare facilities, especially in developing countries. Fortunately, advances in business analytics address this need. This paper aims to describe the experience of a low-income healthcare facility in a developing country in using business analytics descriptive techniques and to discuss business analytics implementation challenges and opportunities in such an environment. Methods: Business analytics descriptive techniques were applied on 3 years’ electronic medical records of outpatient consultation of the University Psychiatric Centre (CPU) of Casablanca. Statistical analysis was conducted to compare results over years. Results: Over the 3 monitored years, the monthly number of computerized physician order entries increased significantly (p < 0.001). Physicians improved their personal recording over years. Schizophrenia as well as depressive and bipolar disorders were noted at the top of outpatient mental disorders. Antipsychotics are the most prescribed drugs, and a significant annual decrease in outpatient care wait time was noted (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Business analytics allowed CPU to monitor mental healthcare outpatient activity and to adopt its business processes according to out-comes. However, challenges mainly in the organizational dimension of the decision-making process and the definition of strategic key metrics, data structuration, and the quality of data entry had to be considered for the optimal use of business analytics. © 2020 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.},

abstract={Across business, industry, government and other areas of human endeavor, vast amounts of data are being accumulated and processed to develop understanding of people's activities, and to optimize organizational processes and outputs. Business analytic related technologies are playing major roles in providing useful insights from vast amount of data. Therefore business analytic programs are becoming more popular among business management graduates. In the other hand, due to the technical nature of the course, it create a fear among young management students. Therefore, the major objectives of the research were threefold; (1) to known about how students' perceived values, academic achievement emotions and perceived success are interrelated in learning business analytic courses, (2) to assess the mediating role of achievement emotion on the relationship between the perceived value and success, (3) the purpose of this study was also to access the moderating effect of academic background (technical, non-technical) and gender (male, female) on the mediating relationship between value, and perceived success via achievement emotion. Survey data from 372 graduate business management students revealed the significant difference of value, emotion and perceived success with respect to academic background and gender. Furthermore, it was found that the enjoyment (one of the dimension of emotions) significantly mediate the relationship between value and students' perceived success in business analytic. It was also found that academic background played a major moderator role in the direct and indirect (via emotion) relation between perceived value and perceived success. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={With the Big Data management, and the propagation of business lines into complex networks, activities are ever more subject to disasters than ever. It is nearly impossible to forecast their happening and degree of related costs. Accordingly, organizations try to collaborate in risk management. This paper outlines and discusses a generic approach based on Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) for cross-management of Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP). A set of basics of disaster planning is also provided. The proposed approach is focused on risk assessment methodology. The method is able to aggregate all assessment variables of the whole stakeholders involved in the business network. The main outcomes of this study aim to support networked enterprises in improving risk readiness capability and disaster recovery. Finally, we indicate the open challenges for further researches and an outlook on our future research. © Copyright 2018 ACM.},

abstract={Business analytics has become more and more relevant to practitioners and academics over the past few years. With vast amounts of data from in- and outside an organization and the availability of fast enough hardware to process it, all functions in an organization aim to benefit from analytics. We conduct a literature review looking at the finance department, i.e. financial and management accounting, and identify hotspots of current and potential future research. We summarize our findings in a framework for literature classification with the two dimensions accounting activity and rationale for business analytics. On this grid, better organization performance and better decision outcomes for most management accounting activities have been covered the most, while support of strategic and tactical goals as well as obtaining value from data should be considered more in detail by future research. © 2018 Universitatsverlag Gottingen.

abstract={The aim of the present paper is, without any pretension of to be exhaustive, to propose a business analytics contribution in the elaboration of a reliable and accurate assessment of firm’s costs function for decision purposes. As a matter of fact, the analyst/consultant, the entrepreneur itself or also the manager has not always the possibility to access to the wide range of all the needed useful information to deal with this task. Income statements or general accounting documents could not record – for an appropriate and sound assessment – all relevant figures. In these (not-extraordinary) cases, supplementary and accurate data gathering is both extremely hard to carry on and not synchronised with entrepreneurial needs. Hence, an analysis developing informed business decisions seems not possible except of roughly approximations. Considering these binding constraints, business analytics tools – by recurring to their interdisciplinary versatility – can surely support managerial decision-making widening and strengthening possibilities to enhance the value of retrievable insights from traditional firm’s accounting data. Under this perspective, management accounting combines its traditional informational power with sound scientific support for a renewed, more efficient and multidisciplinary approach to business.

abstract={Business analytics is an information system that combines different data from internal and external sources from organizations in order to help to improve the knowledge of the managers, as well as the decision making process. The competitive advantage is created by better and greater understanding of the data. It focuses on business and gathers three types of analysis: descriptive, predictive and prescriptive. This study aims to propose a framework that can guide companies in the implementation of business analytics solutions. Moreover, it aims to identify a set of critical success factors that can increase the probability of a successful implementation of the system. The framework and the critical success factors are validated through semi-structured interviews with experts in business analytics, working in the information technology industry. The results let us propose a framework with five stages and the identification of 18 critical success factors. This study allows to expand the knowledge that managers have of business analytics and its implementation, allowing the organization to create value and therefore a competitive advantage. © 2016 AISTI.},

abstract={Providing students with the best learning experience and ensuring their academic success throughout their university lifecycle has been a serious challenge for Higher Education Institutions' (HEIs). Whilst advances in digital technologies have enabled HEIs to collect more data in various forms (Big Data) and as some HEIs begin to realise the strategic potential of using Business Analytics (BA) to support student management, many HEI managers are still sceptical about the use of BA even though they are struggling to make sense of the ever growing amount of data and information. A few BA studies suggest that large commercial companies that use BA perform better than those that do not in making better decisions and creating competitive advantages; however, little academic research exists either to understand the current challenges faced by HEI managers in student management in dealing with big data or explore how BA can be utilised to support student management. Experts in the analytics field have also stated that most literature on analytics focuses on the institutional benefit and not the staff-student benefit. These knowledge gaps constrain HEIs abilities to improve student experience and academic success. Therefore, this research seeks to understand the managerial challenges in student management and explore the use and impact of BA for improving student experience through a date driven student management in UK HEIs from an organisational information processing perspective. Employing a qualitative methodology, this research reports an exploratory case study in a UK university with semi-structured interviews. The initial findings of this research help to develop an understanding of the key challenges faced by the HEI managers in student management, and a preliminary framework for future research on the use and impact of BA student management. This research suggests that BA should play a critical role in effective student management, which therefore leads to better student experience and academic performance.},

abstract={Environmental scanning is an important process that helps organizations sense what is happening in their environments. However, environmental scanning has been found to be less effective than its proponents had hoped for. The problem appears to be that environmental scanning does not lead to the business insights that managers need to help their organizations survive and grow. This paper reports a study into the role of data analytics and knowledge management on environmental scanning and business insight capability. Fifteen indepth interviews were conducted with data analytics professionals to get a deeper understanding of how what they did impacted the results of environmental scanning processes and the generation of business insights. The results indicate data analytics and knowledge management need to play a bigger role in the environmental scanning process if greater business insights are to be generated.},

abstract={This paper focuses on a practice-inspired research challenge of sharing and co-creation of innovative teaching practices in Business Analytics (BA). As confirmed by three international surveys of educators, BA is a very challenging teaching discipline, due to rapidly changing technology, complex data-related challenges, and a disciplinary body of knowledge that is still emerging. However, one of the greatest challenges is a notable absence of well-established teaching practices. The paper describes an action design research project that includes the design and implementation of a wiki-based collaborative environment for sharing of innovative teaching practices as well as the design of a conceptual language that enables these practices to be expressed in a systematic, yet non-prescriptive way. Theoretical underpinning for this work came from the theory of learning designs, a well-known educational taxonomy (the so-called Revised Bloom's taxonomy), instructional design patterns and knowledge management. The paper also identifies some opportunities for further applied research enabled by this evolving knowledge-sharing environment. Marjanovic © 2014.},

abstract={Considering Requirements Engineering (RE) in business analytics, involving market oriented management, computer science and statistics, may be valuable for managing innovation in Product Lifecycle Management (PLM). RE and business analytics can help maximize the value of corporate product information throughout the value chain starting with innovation management. Innovation and PLM must address 1) big data, 2) development of well-defined business goals and principles, 3) cost/benefit analysis, 4) continuous change management, and 5) statistical and report science. This paper is a positioning note that addresses some business case considerations for analytics project involving PLM data, patents, and innovations. We describe a number of research challenges in RE that addresses business analytics when high PLM data should be turned into a successful market oriented innovation management strategy. We provide a draft on how to address these research challenges. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

We use the resource-based view and dynamic capabilities to develop the BA innovation process (BAIP) model, which describes how BA-enabled opportunities are introduced into organisations through a series of innovation cycles. We use the BAIP model to describe how BA-enabled opportunities were selected, justified, implemented and measured through several innovation cycles in a case study of a global wireless device distribution and supply chain provider. Several themes emerge from the case study: The importance of dynamic capabilities in maintaining competitive advantage; governance mechanisms in supporting the innovation cycles; change management when implementing the innovations; organisational learning and feedback mechanisms; measures that demonstrate the effectiveness of the innovations; and alignment of the innovations with organisational strategy.},

abstract={Within construction, we have become increasingly accustomed to relying on the benefits of digital technologies, such as Building Information Modelling, to improve the performance and productivity of projects. We have, however, overlooked the problems that technology is unable to redress. One such problem is rework, which has become so embedded in practice that technology adoption alone can not resolve the issue without fundamental changes in how information is managed for decision-making. Hence, the motivation of this paper is to bring to the fore the challenges of classifying and creating an ontology for rework that can be used to understand its patterns of occurrence and risks and provide a much-needed structure for decision-making in transport mega-projects. Using an exploratory case study approach, we examine ‘how’ rework information is currently being managed by an alliance that contributes significantly to delivering a multi-billion dollar mega-transport project. We reveal the challenges around location, format, structure, granularity and redundancy hindering the alliance's ability to classify and manage rework data. We use the generative machine learning technique of Correlation Explanation to illustrate how we can make headway toward classifying and then creating an ontology for rework. We propose a theoretical framework utilising a smart data approach to generate an ontology that can effectively use business analytics (i.e., descriptive, predictive and prescriptive) to manage rework risks. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper proposes that the relationship between business analytics and innovative performance is somewhat more complex than originally thought, as firms still struggle to leverage the benefits of business analytics and artificial intelligence capabilities. To expand on the scholarship in this area of knowledge, our paper cross-fertilizes the literature by amalgamating business analytics capabilities with π-shaped skills. We draw on resource orchestration theory to examine the effects of business analytics and π-shaped skills on a firm's innovative performance, and the moderating role of π-shaped skills. Field data (n = 450) were obtained from individuals with supervisory positions in large Saudi firms and SMEs and analyzed with PLS-SEM and fsQCA techniques. PLS-SEM results reveal that business analytics and π-shaped skills are relevant antecedents for innovative performance. However, the expected moderating role of π-shaped skills on the relationship between business analytics and innovative performance did not hold. FsQCA results reveal that business analytics and π-shaped skills are sufficient but not necessary conditions for high innovative performance. This paper contributes not only to empirical evidence, but also to theory by furthering our understanding of the emergent π-shaped skills concept. Our findings echo the need to expand inquiry into business analytics and skill sets capabilities for better innovative outputs. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), big data (BD), and digital transformation (DT), analytics students should gain the ability to solve business problems by integrating various methods. This teaching brief illustrates how two such methods—Bayesian analysis and Markov chains—can be combined to enhance student learning using the Analytics Project Life Cycle Management (APLCM) approach and a case study involving qualitative forecasting. The theoretical frameworks for combining Bayesian and Markov methods are developed, and a forecasting solution is implemented in both MS Excel and Python. Based on an assessment of student learning, applying this pedagogical approach helps students better use these disjoint methods and appreciate the value of integrating them. Although this teaching brief is designed and most appropriate for graduate students with previous BA courses, it can also be used in upper-level courses within an undergraduate BA curriculum. Finally, this teaching brief provides the instructors wishing to use this pedagogical approach in their appropriate courses with the necessary resources (i.e., case study, in-class example, and the MS Excel and Python templates). © 2021 Decision Sciences Institute},

abstract={Organizations consider human capital as one of their most important assets. Experts in the field have focused on the research and development of human talent management skills. At present, companies are giving high importance to the management of this intangible resource. Management by competencies and skills is basic in the selection and development of the most valuable asset the organization has: its human capital. A conceptual framework of the intelligent management of human capital and some more advanced knowledge discovery techniques are presented in this paper. A methodology for smart detection of core competencies based on fuzzy logic predicates and business analytics is proposed. The proposed methodology allows: (1) the evaluation of the importance of competencies, (2) the identification of competencies achievement level of each employee, (3) the identification of competencies with difficulties, (4) the identification of competencies that have influence on others, and (5) a hierarchization of the competencies to select the most appropriated for the employee recruitment plan. Furthermore, an analysis is proposed using knowledge discovery, which allows one to identify which competences have influence on a specific one. All of the above is useful to build an ideal profile for a position. A case study was carried out in order to show the implementation and interpretation of our proposal. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The main aim of this paper is to identify and specify factors that influence business analyt-ics. A factor in this context refers to any significant characteristic that defines the environment in which business analytics and business in general are conducted. Factors and their understanding are essential for the quality of final business analytics solutions, given their complexity and inter-connectedness. Factors play an extremely important role in analytic thinking and business analysts’ skills and knowledge. These factors determine effective approaches and procedures for business analytics, and, in some cases, they also aid in the decision to delay a business analytics solution given a situation. This paper has used the case study method, a qualitative research method, due to the need to carry out investigation within the actual business (company) environment, in order to be able to fully understand and verify factors affecting analytics from the viewpoint of all stakeholders. This study provides a set of 15 factors from business, company, and market environments, including their importance in business analytics. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={We present an expanded framework for the use of business analytics in projects. To the commonly used descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, we add comparative analytics, wherein we compare the performance of systems under different interventions. This framework provides a conceptual roadmap for the implementation of business analytics projects. We then demonstrate this framework using recent operations research literature on analytics in healthcare, summarizing papers focusing on one of these aspects. Next, we discuss queue mining as an example of theory and practice illustrative of these aspects. We conclude there is room for further work by operations researchers and management scientists within business analytics projects generally and the healthcare industry more specifically. We argue future work should consider both theory and practice, especially within prescriptive analytics projects, where analysis through the lens of operations research and management science is imperative. We provide some thoughts on the current and future state of operations research and management science in business analytics. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

funding_text 1={We conclude that implementing business analytics in healthcare services is challenging. This conclusion is supported by others. For example, Scheinker and Brandeau ( 2020 ) shed light on the challenges involved in successfully implementing analytics projects in hospitals. Despite the expertise of ORMS professionals in prescriptive analytics in challenging settings, there is less impact than desired of prescriptive analytics on practice. We see implementation of prescriptive analytics projects in general and in healthcare in particular as an exciting and challenging opportunity to extend the impact of business analytics.},

abstract={Data is a key component of smart manufacturing coming from various sources and in different forms. The amount of data produced in the Manufacturing Data Life Cycle (MDLC) could be vast and remain useless if not processed and mapped into information that is understood by users. Because of the data volume, velocity, variety, and veracity, it is not feasible to expect humans to analyze it using traditional manufacturing tools; business analytics solutions provide more efficient means. In this paper, first, we aim at identifying the latest research areas and trends of business analytics (BA) in the production management (PM) literature using text mining, bibliometric mapping, and visual analytics. We discuss the related research gaps, BA challenges and problems and give suggestions for possible BA applications and future research directions. Second, we selected the performance management and decision-making cluster for presenting a real-world case and we applied MDLC as a framework. The case study presents a big data analytics performance monitoring system from a multi-product refinery. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={The idea of ‘big data’ provides practitioners in the logistics industry with valuable opportunities to improve their operational efficiency and economic performance. In fact, business analytics techniques are increasingly being used in international logistics, shipping, and supply chain management. We examine the impact of business intelligence (BI) system adoption on firms’ market value and the influences of the operating characteristics and contexts of firms. Specifically, we examine whether the impacts of BI adoption are contingent on industry competitiveness, firms’ operating cycle, and industry munificence. Using the event study methodology, we analyse 272 manufacturing firms in the USA that adopted BI systems from 2005 to 2014. We find that BI adoption does not have an immediate impact on firms’ stock returns, but such impact is significantly enhanced for firms in highly competitive industries, and those with short operating cycles and high industry munificence, i.e., high-growth industries, suggesting that firms in fast-changing dynamic environments find BI systems much more useful. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={This study aims to investigate the factors influencing the success of MOOCs. By adopting a learning model, we map in-platform information into three categories: presage, process, and product. We propose that factors related to learners, instructors, courses, platforms, and learning activities influence completion rate and course evaluation. We analyze in-platform information about 1,000 business analytics courses from Udemy. We find that learners consider price when evaluating courses. However, price is not a motivation to complete courses. Instructors can increase the completion rate by providing short videos and posting regular assignments. Also, there is no need to post information on the MOOCs platforms if the information is common for most courses. This study enriches the understanding of learners' behavior in MOOCs environment by elaborating on the relationship between in-platform factors and the success of MOOCs. The findings provide practical implications on information management in MOOCs platforms. © AMCIS 2021.},

abstract={The purpose of this research is to introduce an innovative decision architecture to assess corporate risks by utilizing accounting narratives and to further examine the association between those risks and operating performance. We run text mining algorithms to identify the types of risks from narratives and incorporate them with a readability measure (i.e., linguistic cue(s)) to conjecture a firm manager’s attitude toward corporate risk. We consider a two-stage network data envelopment analysis (TNDEA) with the benefit of opening up the black-box of a production process via considering internal activities. The outcome derived from TNDEA is determined by users who decide “a priori” what the specification of the model should be, without considering any alternatives. The study further incorporates the fuzzy rough set theory (FRST) with TNDEA by considering inclusion/exclusion or different combinations of inputs, intermediates, and outputs so as to realize a corporate’s underlying business situation. Decision attributes taken from the outcome of FRST-TNDEA and condition attributes gathered from annual reports are jointly inserted into an artificial intelligence (AI) technique to establish the forecasting model. The integrated circuit (IC) industry has long been viewed as an essential backbone of Taiwan’s economy, and therefore it is taken as our research target. The results show that the introduced linguistic cues have positive and considerable impacts on firm performance. Overall, the findings herein provide direct support for recent regulators that require corporates to add a new section on risk factors in accounting narratives so as to prevent users from making biased judgments. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This paper describes how business analytics novel software tools combined with advanced data management techniques can be integrated to management workflows and decision-making processes of a Coiled Tubing Service Company (CTSC). An advanced data wrangling process (transforming and mapping data) was designed and implemented to unify current and historical coiled tubing operational data into a single data set. The latter was regularly updated with the latest operational information through an automated data querying process that eliminated the need for manually repeating the data wrangling. A Business Analytics Software (BAS) was used to accelerate the engineering of a Data Analytics (DA) process, identify correlations and trends, design data models, and create relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPI). Finally, BAS visualization tools were used to prepare and publish comprehensive cloud-based Business Intelligence (BI) dashboards and reports. The BI dashboard allows the coiled tubing company to quickly perform accurate and efficient analysis of the KPI trends of its coiled tubing units and well interventions. The cloud-based Dashboard enables the CTSC to: • Effectively identify Coiled Tubing Strings utilization, costs, failures, vendors, and design performance trends based on factual data, thus enabling informed pipe management decisions. • Clearly Identify high performance coiled tubing units and crews and make strategic decisions for high profile jobs. • Identify equipment failures, non-productive time (NPT) trends and define, implement, and monitor maintenance and asset management strategies to tackle the failures with mayor impact on operations performance. • Easily incorporate fresh operational data and detect record-breaking operations. • Improve Customer Relationship Management by a quickly responding to customer inquiries for tailor-made operations performance reports. • Decrease workload on repetitive processes by enabling reports generation with relevant and accurate data faster that previous methods in place. • Quickly customize and create accurate documentation compiling relevant performance data in a consistent and standardized fashion. • Perform well interventions technical analysis. The contemporary approach to integrate BI Software to coiled tubing operations is a step change in how service companies and operators are analyzing and monitoring performance (efficiency, safety, and quality) to differentiate from each other, optimize results and minimize costs. This paper describes an example of a simple yet sophisticated and effective way of incorporating digital tools in the oilfield services processes by utilizing in house talent and resources.

abstract={The increasing digitalization in the automotive industry is influencing the structure of the traditional value chain and calls for the handling of large amounts of data to remain competitive in a constantly changing environment. This results in new challenges for purchasing management, which has to cope with agile integration of service providers as well as interorganizational process automation using electronic data exchange platforms. This work analyzes the electronic document stream on supplier management platforms by proposing an automated text mining framework. Both textual components, e. g., requests for information and offers, and narrative material, e. g., financial and calculation data, are being analyzed by topic modeling and descriptive statistics. The methodological approach is introduced and illustrated by the use case of service provider documents in purchasing processes. The results reveal financial potential for purchasing and generally contribute to supply chain cost management. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Organizations invest heavily in Business Analytics (BA), but many fail to realize the expected benefits. Although emerging empirical findings suggest a positive impact of BA on firm performance, explanations of BA value creation remain superficial. Extant firm-level theory cannot cope with the complexity of increasingly powerful BA applications across diverse business processes. We take a process-level perspective to organize BA value creation along the Information Value Chain (IVC). Based on a qualitative literature review in IS, Operations Research, and General Management, we (I) construct a comprehensive and consistent overview of potential outcomes, (II) propose a refined process model of value creation, and (III) identify the major inhibitors of value realization from BA. We summarize major research gaps and promising research directions. Our findings contribute to extant research by refining and extending the IVC. They also guide practitioners in realizing value from BA. © ICIS 2020. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Supply chain management (SCM) functions are having applications of business analytics (BA). Supply chain managers' uses BA as competitive tool. Application of BA in key SCM functions, with information technology (IT) innovations has been a topic of tremendous interest to both practitioners and researchers. We identified more than 200 articles (over two decade) and classified them by year of publication, functional discipline, publication source, research methodology and application for the purpose of comprehensive literature review.

abstract={This paper aims to introduce business analytics strategies that one of the most prominent public accounting firms, Deloitte, has applied to manage hundreds of thousands of clients and discover valuable insights within the organization to increase efficiency and improve risk management. According to Deloitte official website, 76% of audit committee members within the organization believe that advanced technology should be used more extensively [1]. The insights gained from the data analytics are approved by the most occupied position in the accounting firm, which is the auditors. This paper introduces insight-driven methods used in the company, including Profit model, Network, Structure, Process, Product performance, Product system, Service, Channel, Brand, and Customer engagement. All of t ase elements can each be integrated into a business analytic approach. Lastly, this paper will provide some limitations associated with the data analysis in the firm. © The Authors, publis ad by EDP Sciences, 2020.},

abstract={As a growing number of companies emphasize the core focus on analyzing the generated data and hold data-driven decision-making in esteem, quantitative methods and data modeling have been widely used for a variety of purposes in recent years [1]. Although there is no doubt in the great value brought by business analytics, very little attention has been paid to the specific effects from the perspective of the enterprises, nor empirically or statistically verified at a large scale. This prospective study sets out to obtain first-hand data from carefully designed questionnaires and theoretically investigate the impact of business analytics on market performance, work efficiency, and operational costs. This is one of the first attempts to quantitively analyze their relationship and will generate fresh insights into the field of corporate governance and business management. The questionnaires were distributed among 1781 firms in China, which are divided into the control group and experimental group based on their responses. By comparison, the results demonstrate that business analytics gives a big push in enhancing market performance, boosting work efficiency, and reducing operational costs. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={In an increasingly changing market environment, the long-term survival of companies depends on their ability to reduce latencies in adapting to new market conditions. One strategy to meet this challenge is the anchoring of data-driven decision making, which leads to an increasing use of advanced information technologies and, subsequently, to an increase in the amount of data stored. The complexity of processing these data spurred the demand for advanced statistical methods and functions called Business Analytics. Companies are, despite all promised benefits, overwhelmed with the implementation of Business Analytics as indicated by a failure rate of 65 to 80 %. This paper provides an empirically validated, multi-dimensional model that takes an integrative look at critical success factors for the implementation of Business Analytics and based on which management recommendations can be generated. For this purpose, constructs of the model are conceptualized, before a structural equation model is developed. This model is then validated with data from 69 industrial partners in the food industry. It is shown amongst others, that the three success factors top management support, IT infrastructure and system quality are pivotal to increase the company performance. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Monitoring credit product indicators in Peruvian banking is, generally, carried out semi-automatically, therefore its process can generate delays and induce errors in the financial analysis and, as a result, lead to untimely decision-making. In this work, a business analytics model is proposed to automate this process in Peruvian banks, which considers 4 components: Dashboard Management, Data Management, Visualizer and Information Display. The model is applicable to any bank for its simplicity and for the various existing technologies that facilitate its implementation. In addition, ATC (Analysis & Tracking of Credits) a web application that uses BI&A tools supported in the Cloud, is developed, showing 12 financial variables and 4 indicators of profitability and financial strength. Test with real data from a bank and expert judgement show a reduction in time from 29.7 hours to 4.3 seconds, and a positive impact on aspects such as usability and user experience. © 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

Data is ubiquitous, and the everyday enormous amount of data is being generated from a plethora of data sources. Not all data that are generated are useful for business and its users. However, handpicking the relevant data in a most readily available format can be an indispensable asset since it derives multifarious insights into the business.

abstract={Business Analytics (BA) has attracted great interest among firms of most sectors worldwide, as it enables a more advanced and valuable exploitation of firms’ data assets, beyond operations, for the supporting of decision-making. However, though numerous firms take some first steps in this area, most of them make limited use of BA in some of their activities, and cannot advance to a more extensive adoption of BA throughout their activities, so they do not exploit the full potential of it. For this reason, some first research has been conducted on BA adoption and factors affecting it, however more research is required on this topic. Our study makes a contribution to this research stream, by investigating empirically the effect of the extent of enterprise systems (such as ERP, CRM and SCM ones) adoption, as well as the degree of development of firm’s ICT capabilities, distinguishing between technological and management ones, on the extent of BA adoption. It has been based on the Technology, Organization and Environment (TOE) framework. We have used data collected from 363 Greek firms from both manufacturing and services sectors through a questionnaire, from which ordinal regression models are estimated. It has been concluded that both the adoption of enterprise systems, as well as the development of firm’s ICT capabilities, and especially the ICT management capabilities, affect positively the extent of BA adoption. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={We surveyed 72 managers and executives from Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Football League (NFL), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Hockey League (NHL), and Major League Soccer (MLS), as well as other North American professional sport organisations including auto racing, golf, and tennis regarding the use of business analytics in sport marketing and revenue generation. We explore the use of business analytics to drive improvement in ticket pricing, customer retention, lead scoring, sponsorship, premium sales, digital marketing, food and beverage, merchandising, and fan/game experience. The main contribution of this paper is to show how managers of professional sport franchises in North America utilise business analytics to drive revenue generation and to provide possible theoretical avenues of future research. Managerial implications are that customer relationship management (CRM) and food, beverage, and merchandising are increasing areas of interest. Areas of prevalence are highlighted as well as areas of potential improvement for the use of analytics in professional sports organisations. Copyright © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Undergraduate and graduate programs conducted with the names of Business Analytics, Data Analytics, Big Data Analytics and Business Intelligence have become one of the most discussed topics both in academia and in the market novadays. This current discussion is due to the increasing importance of the management and analysis of Big Data, which has emerged as a result of developments in Information Technology and science. In order to meet the needs of both academy and the companies about how to take advantage of Big Data, many universities in Europe and USA have established analytics related graduate programs. This paper investigates recent analytics related programs in Turkey and determines whether these programs can meet the needs and demands of the companies by considering the literature on analytics education and assessing a maturity score based on the offered analytics related classes. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Managing the response to reported gas leaks is of significant importance to both utilities and regulators. This paper utilizes a business analytics approach to investigate strategies for managing gas leak response while balancing the objectives of both utilities and regulators. The approach integrates the translation of the business issue into a quantitative framework by which actual gas leak data can be analysed and modelled to measure the performance of different gas leak response strategies. An agent-based simulation model is utilized to provide a decision support platform that translates the analytic results into a visualization tool to assist stakeholders and decision makers in evaluating the impact of different response strategies. The paper highlights both the analytic methods and the related “soft skills” that must be managed in the business analytics context to ensure an outcome that is acceptable for all stakeholders. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

abstract={A case study is presented in this paper that introduces a novel approach to Performance Management (PM) in an Exploration and Production Development Company (E&PDC). Typically, performance is measured at a functional level without sufficient attention to the validity of the Strategy, and the efficiency of the organization, or its leadership. Business analytics, and risk-based planning is used to improve the application of the business Strategy in an E&PDC. The case study described in this paper examines the Strategic performance, and the organization’s efficiency as part of the Performance Management system. Data Analytics was conducted on consolidated 12 years historical performance metrics to identify, the Health of the Strategy, correlations of different Performance Management metrics, and, leadership efficiency. Strategic outlook was developed using multi variable regression to slice, and dice business performance profiles, assess risk, as well as opportunity. Risk based planning is then conducted on the statistical results to quantitively rank the E&PDC enterprise risks. The results indicate significant diversity in the organizational structure, and associated workflow. Consequently, the functional performance in the E&PDC is variable, and is often downgraded by incomplete workflow, and inadequate organization efficiency. However, the shortfalls of the business performance whether in organization, or workflow presents a wealth of information that can be readily used to improve business performance. Therefore, work in this paper provides the opportunity to improve cost per barrel by up to 20%, a reduction of up to 30% in capital investments, and a up to 25% decrease of man-hours required to carry out core business functions. The benefits of aligning organization capabilities with the Strategy, and revisiting policy is underlined in this paper. The economic viability challenges facing the oil and gas sector today require a lean approach to manage business liabilities. This can only be achieved with measurement of functional, organizational and strategy, performance and the development of risk-based business plans that prioritize annual business plans.

Two highly innovative undergraduate degree programs are offered: Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics. Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured. New computational and analytic approaches to a vast array of forms, scales, and sources of data are now critical to research, decision-making, and action. The rigorous curriculum in Data Science program focuses on the fundamentals of applied mathematics, computer science, probability, statistics, optimization, and machine learning while incorporating real-world examples. Business Analytics is analytics expertise with a business focus. It is a cutting-edge program especially designed to prepare students for top jobs in today's technology and data intensive business world. The curriculum provides extensive instruction in the disciplines of optimization, mathematical modeling, probabilistic and statistical analysis, simulation, computer programming, database, data and text mining, and cloud computing. The curriculum also includes classes in subject areas you would expect to find in a more traditional business program, such as economics, accounting, finance, operations management, supply chain management, entrepreneurship, business law, negotiation, project management, and strategy. The curricula of two programs are intertwined by first year common and several common courses and senior yearlong industry project. In this paper we highlight curriculum development along with learning objectives. © IEOM Society International.},

abstract={The City of Houston is the fourth largest City in the United States. Houston Water owns and operates thirty-nine (39) Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) with total permitted wastewater treatment capacity of 564 MGD. It also owns and operates 384 collection system lift stations spatially distributed across the City. The City's wastewater infrastructure includes hundreds of vertical and linear assets. Since the mid-2000s, the City has used Infor Enterprise Asset Management (InforEAM) to document inventory and day-to-day work order management for the vertical assets/ facilities and CityWorks for the linear assets. Recently, the City has undertaken an initiative to update its asset inventory through field data collection at all wastewater facilities. This initiative also includes assessing the conditions of the assets. Using the updated asset inventory along with its condition, the City has developed a methodology for updating its Strategic Asset Management (SAM) Plan. As part of SAM, the Houston Water Planning team developed a dynamic and interactive decision-making tool for asset life-cycle based analysis and planning utilizing field verified asset information including the condition. The following details the City's wastewater facilities Strategic Asset Management methodology and associated tool. Copyright © 2018 Water Environment Federation},

abstract={Organizations are increasingly required to make use of the considerable amount of data that is left behind as persistent digital traces in all social media. Consequently, IS researchers contributed first frameworks to structure the social media analytics domain. However, so far there is a lack of attention to the actual managers' views on the use of social media based metrics and related approaches of business analytics for their decision making requirements. In this article we aim to develop a more realistic picture of this context and its challenges by exploring the experiences and views of managers that intensively work with social media in a very large international organization that is very invested and proficient in its online business. Our research reveals five organizational business analytics challenges that relate to the local contextuality of the analysis, the related difficulties with combining insights from different departments, a poor connectability with existing organizational KPI. Further, from the managers' perspective, the measures itself were found to lack continuity and comprehensiveness. Based on these findings, we develop and offer the 5C framework as a first step towards better integrating the important needs of users and managers into the social media analytics research discourse. © 26th European Conference on Information Systems: Beyond Digitization - Facets of Socio-Technical Change, ECIS 2018.

abstract={Advertisement (hereby referred as 'ad') blockers are a continuous emerging threat to Digital Content Writers. While most of the creators prefer to keep the content free by allowing ads, these Ad blockers are causing harm. They are useful to block spam ads but without any means of segregation between good or bad, it is prone to block 'Advertisements'. This paper focuses on how the Business analysis could be employed to construct a strategy that companies that display written content like e-newspapers & e-magazines could employ to deal with the threat posed by Advertisement blocking software. The problem statement is explained in four phases of Business Analytics: Operations Analytics studied the models that predict the effect of the Ad-blockers on the organization; Customer Analytics guided the research by predicting the customer behaviour, marketing decisions, and Strategy. Accounting Analytics dealt with how the Ad-blockers affect the company's financial bottom line. Finally, People Analytics suggested the measures that strengthen the company's internal organization to deal with Ad-blockers. The main strategy to tackle this issue was taken from Wharton's Future of Advertising (WFoA) program's R.A.V.E.S.[1] that is an advertisement must be relevant and respectful, actionable, valuable and value generating with exceptional experience and share-worthy story from the end user. Alternative strategies like Enhancing the User Experience in the mobile application, collaborating and sharing knowledge articles with similar companies was also discussed. The anticipated effects of the proposed strategy were measured through various metrics that included customer satisfaction levels through paid apps, subscription fees, pay-per-click thoughts. Key drivers to the customer's chance of viewing the advertisement were discussed along with questions for measurement were answered thereby giving the entire Business Analytics Model implementation. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Business Analytics is arguably the most dominant topic of discussion among both academics and practitioners. As organizations scramble to derive insights from rapidly growing data, we see an exponential growth in the number of articles related to Business Analytics. The purpose of this article is to examine the conceptual foundations of the field of analytics based on an analysis of articles that have appeared in the IS senior scholars’ basket of eight journals during the last 25 years (1992 - 2016). Using a combination of citation analysis and text mining, our study: (a) reveals the disciplines that influence Business Analytics research in information systems; and (b) explicates dominant themes latent in the corpus. Concepts related to Predictive Analytics, Business Intelligence, the Web, IT Management, Firm Performance and Decision Support were found to be at the heart of analytics research conducted by IS scholars in the basket of eight journals. © 2017 AIS/ICIS Administrative Office.

abstract={Nowadays, crowdfunding is becoming more and more popular. Many studies have been published on the crowdfunding platform from different perspectives. However, among all these studies, few are concerned about the recommendation methods, which, in effect, are highly beneficial to crowdfunding websites and the participants. Having considered the situation talked above, this paper works out the several features from the relative projects of user's current browsing project. Then we give different weights to each feature based on selective attention phenomenon, and adopt the method of OWA operator to calculate the final score of each relative project and accomplish our model by picking out the four projects with different outstanding characteristics. Finally, according to the statistics on China's famous crowdfunding website, we conducted a group of contrast experiments and eventually testified that our proposed model could, to some extent, help classify and give recommendation effectively. Furthermore, the results of this research can give guidance to the management of crowdfunding websites and they are also very significant advices for the future crowdfunding website development.},

abstract={A Reservoir Data Warehouse has been successfully created where key subsurface information used for geophysical reservoir monitoring has been transformed, integrated, and stored into a geospatially registered relational database. Quantitative 4D analysis has been performed on the data, utilising the power of the massively parallel processing architecture of the high-performance analytical database, and combining traditional 4D analysis and business analytics tools. The 4D analysis successfully demonstrated quantitative relationships between the different data in the database. If desired, the integrated data model can be extended with other types of data like top side data. At its simplest the Reservoir Data Warehouse will enable a more sustainable and easily accessible solution for data integration and co-visualization, and simplification in the data management realm. At its most powerful the Reservoir Data Warehouse will enable the creation of new subsurface workflows where data from disparate origins can be analyzed jointly and presented in existing software solutions, or in newly developed cross-disciplinary software solutions.},

They involve technology and data infrastructure, BA capabilities, and business processes that provide useful insights and support decision-making. To provide value and competitive advantage, BA capabilities should be valuable, rare, inimitable and have organisational support (VRIO). In this paper, we develop and evaluate a prototype dashboard for the VRIO assessment of BA capabilities. The dashboard is intended to support the strategic management of BA capabilities. We discuss implications of the prototype dashboard for researchers and practitioners and suggest directions for future research. © 2014 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Self-service Business Intelligence (BI) is considered as a querying and reporting tool. The need for Self-service analytics is inevitable as it supports the business in making the right decisions. In this paper, we argue that self-service analytics frameworks should be based on a process-centric approach and visualized self-service components in order to meet current business demands. Further, we enunciate the need for mainly three components: Map component, Process Flow component and a Control Model component. Furthermore, we explain the conceptual framework of a self-service business analytics based on these components. Some parts of the proposed framework were deployed and are discussed in detail in the paper.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a scientometric research on Business Analytics concept aiming to analyze the literature in a quantitative and descriptive way. In order to develop this research, it was conducted a literature review considering all papers that had the term "Business Analytics" in the title and which were published from 2002 to 2012. The findings presented in this paper are based on 155 papers found, being 137 identified as publications in IT and business magazines and just a few number of articles a total of 23 articles were published in academic journals. The findings corroborate that BA is becoming very well known among a large number of companies worldwide, being applied in order to improve business process performance. Since BA concept is in an embryonic state, more researches should be conducted in order to build a more robust literature under the realm of business administration considering the scarcity of empirical articles in reputable academic journals.},

abstract={Business analytics provide large enterprises an edge over their competitors, depending upon the size of the data analyzed and the time needed to generate business models. This requires an infrastructure model that meets these huge demands on large scale data processing. Cloud computing provides low cost storage space of virtually any size on demand which can host the data perpetually. Similarly, the processing power can also be commissioned as and when needed. Enterprises are constantly in search of simple and inexpensive systems which transform the available raw data to useful information. In this context, we propose a new framework named Biztool, where a collection of data analytic operators based on Gridbatch is provided as web services that process the data remotely. Biztool is flexible and customizable through user-defined functions. Since various clients can reuse the existing operators for their needs, the development and maintenance cost are reduced. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In the following article we point out the potentials of semantic technologies for an application in the area of business analytics. Semantic Business Analytics as understood by the operators of a power plant means to provide intelligent, experience based monitoring of the machines' sensor data, to provide interactive guidelines to advise the operator to take the right steps, and to provide a mechanism to learn from past incidents. Therefore a sensor-based ontology represents a predictive model for the behaviour of mechanical and electrical parts of a power plant under certain circumstances. Rules are crucial in this application, as they represent, as so called monitors, complex relationships between different elements (energy medium, parts of the plant, and environmental influence) and their behaviour in time. Acting as semantic agents, these monitors observe the power plant and create alerts in case of an incident. The alert is used by an ontology-based advisory system which guides the operator how to deal with and fix the problem. The knowledge engineer is able to improve the system by learning from past incidents by analyzing the stored incidents and derive new experience and monitors from. Monitoring systems may be classified as business analytics systems and thus this application shows the benefits of semantic technologies in business analytics respectively business intelligence.},

abstract={The chapter presents a conceptual framework that identifies technological and organizational factors that impact the success of business analytics (BA) use in organizations in general and virtual organizations in particular. The framework explores BA success through three business disciplines: Decision sciences (DS), information systems (IS), and management. We believe that BA success comes from proper interaction between the three disciplines. Though the concept of BA has been around for a long time in business literature, its full potential use has not been realized in organizations for a variety of reasons. The information and communication technologies (ICT) that have made virtual organizations, and flattening of the world possible have also created a better infrastructure/environment for use of BA by providing the capability to collect massive amounts of data and by providing easier-to-use analytic tools. Currently, BA is being touted as the next information technology (IT) capability that will generate considerable value including competitive advantage to businesses. In this chapter we present and discuss our framework, discuss its viability through existing examples of BA success, and finally apply the framework to a special emerging context in organizations, virtual organizing. Implications of this framework for identifying and filling research gaps in this area and implications for managers interested in exploring BA use in their organizations are presented. © 2009, IGI Global.},
