abstract={“Big Data” is an emerging term used with business, engineering, and other domains. Although Big Data is a popular term used today, it is not a new concept. However, the means in which data can be collected is more readily available than ever, which makes Big Data more relevant than ever because it can be used to improve decisions and insights within the domains it is used. The term Big Data can be loosely defined as data that is too large for traditional analysis methods and techniques. In this article, varieties of prominent but loose definitions for Big Data are shared. In addition, a comprehensive overview of issues related to Big Data is summarized. For example, this paper examines the forms, locations, methods of analyzing and exploiting Big Data, and current research on Big Data. Big Data also concerns a myriad of tangential issues, from privacy to analysis methods that will also be overviewed. Best practices will further be considered. Additionally, the epistemology of Big Data and its history will be examined, as well as technical and societal problems existing with Big Data. © 2016,IGI Global.},

abstract={Today, mobile phone is an essential part of the lives of most people – a reason why, banking sector and mobile phone service providers have teamed up to provide banking services to customers via mobile phones. However, customers often are critical of the quality of such alternative financial delivery services provided by banks. The aim of this paper is to examine the underlying factors and service qualities that can influence customers’ behavioral intentions towards the use of mobile banking services in Bangladesh. The hybrid model in this study identifies service qualities like reliability, privacy, information quality, responsiveness and empathy that capture customers’ overall perceptions of the performance of mobile banking services. In addition, other factors like performance expectancy, effort expectancy and facilitating conditions significantly influence customers’ intention to use such services. Implications of these findings provide practical recommendations to banking industry, and directions for further work from the perspective of Bangladesh. Copyright © 2016, IGI Global.},

abstract={Modern technologies have allowed for the amassment ofdata at a rate never encounteredbefore. Organizations are now able to routinely collect and process massive volumes of data. A plethora of regularly collected information can be ordered using an appropriate time interval. The data would thus be developed into a time series. Time series data mining methodology identifies commonalities between sets of time-ordered data. Time series data mining detects similar time series using a technique known as dynamic time warping (DTW). This research provides a practical application of time series data mining. A real-world data set was provided to the authors by dunnhumby. A time series data mining analysis is performed using retail grocery store chain data and results are provided.

abstract={Social media has gained a lot of importance in this modern high-speed world where people sprint to save every bit of time and money. Social media, considered “big data”, is finding legitimate and practical uses in political campaigns, job applications, business promotion, professional networking, and customer service. The use of data mining social media is reshaping business models, accelerating “viral” marketing, and enabling the rapid growth of grassroots communities. In addition, organizations now rely on social media for interacting internally as well as externally. Industries from manufacturing to retail to financial services, rely ever-more heavily on the use of social media causing an exploding Social Media Mining (SMM) applications market with a growing list of software vendors and consulting firms all jockeying for position in this burgeoning market. This paper is intent on accomplishing a systematic presentation of the body of knowledge in the growing field of SMM. Copyright © 2016, IGI Global.},

abstract={From green supply chain perspective of the internet of things, actualization of the IoT into the complex system for green inventory management will link the real world with the digital world seamlessly. Modeling the complex systems in green supply chain can be hard in a computational utilization and inventory management of relationships exists. Two of the problems of IoT-enabled system are the lack of stable integrated architecture and autonomous mechanism. This paper proposes the intelligent IoT-enabled system in green supply chain using FCM and fuzzy QFD method. It aims to simulate complex system by linked physical and digital objects with relationships while enhancing decision-making performance efficiency for green inventory management. A case study and experiment evaluation of the proposed FCM approach on green supply chain is presented to provide some indication for work improvement. The experiment compares the total effects performance of the green inventory status as estimated by the two methods using the proposed IoT-enabled FCM and traditional FCM.

abstract={The internet era creates new types of large and real-time data; much of those data are non-standard such as streaming and sensor-generated data. Advanced big data technologies enable organizations to extract insights from sophisticated data. Volume, variety and velocity represent big data challenges, which cause difficulties in capture, storage, search, sharing, analysis and visualization. Therefore, technologies like No-SQL, Hadoop and cloud computing used to extract value from large volumes and a wide variety of data to discover business needs. This article’s goal is to focus on the challenges of big data and how the recent technologies can be used to address those issues, which are illustrated through real world case studies. The article also presents the lessons learned from these case studies. Copyright © 2014 IGI Global.},

abstract={The stock market is very volatile and non-stationary and generates huge volumes of data in every second. In this article, the existing machine learning algorithms are analyzed for stock market forecasting and also a new pattern-finding algorithm for forecasting stock trend is developed. Three approaches can be used to solve the problem: fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and the machine learning. Experimental analysis done in this article shows that the machine learning could be useful for investors to make profitable decisions. In order to conduct these processes, a real-time dataset has been obtained from the Indian stock market. This article learns the model from Indian National Stock Exchange (NSE) data obtained from Yahoo API to forecast stock prices and targets to make a profit over time. In this article, two separate algorithms and methodologies are analyzed to forecast stock market trends and iteratively improve the model to achieve higher accuracy. Results are showing that the proposed pattern-based customized algorithm is more accurate (10 to 15%) as compared to other two machine learning techniques, which are also increased as the time window increases. © 2019, IGI Global.},

abstract={The suppliers, which are one of the most important actors in the supply chain, have a significant effect on the performances of their customer firms. Hence, supplier performance evaluation has become a competitive tool in today’s goods and service producing industries. This paper presents a supplier performance evaluation process developed using the Six Sigma Define – Measure – Analyse – Improve – Control (DMAIC) methodology. The proposed process has been applied in a central services company, where the suppliers had never been evaluated before. To this end, first of all, the evaluation criteria have been defined through brainstorming and meetings within the company, then weighted with Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and categorized according to Kano’s Model. Afterwards, suppliers have been scored and classified based on a proposed methodology using a modified version of Kano’s model, and thus, the proposed process has proven to be useful in real life industrial applications.

abstract={Lean is a systematic approach to identify and eliminate non-value-added activities or waste through continuous improvement process. While traditional lean manufacturing focuses on the activities within a single organization, lean supply chain consists of the same processes, but it views these processes over multiple organizations. This research addresses an important yet under-studied area – lean supply chain management in small organizations, especially small manufacturing firms. The study examines driving factors of lean supply chain management, focus of lean supply chain practices, and major supply chain and information technology solutions applied in these companies. Through a research survey, the study has provided important insights into the current status of lean supply chain practices and related implementation issues in small businesses.

abstract={Supply chain networks have expanded globally in today’s business environment due to cost efficiencies, advanced technology, and market growth. This expansion makes the supply chains more vulnerable to disruption risks in different countries. A disruption in one country can cause serious global impacts. In this article, we formulate a multi-criteria optimization model for supporting strategic supply chain network design decisions. The modelconsiders disruption riskofsupply chain components (i.e., facilities andtransportation links)as well as profit and customer responsiveness as conflicting criteria. This consideration is important since disruption at any supply chain component may lead to the disruption of the entire supply chain network. We apply goal programming (GP) techniques to handle multiple and conflicting network design objectives. We also present a numerical example to illustrate how to incorporate disruption risk when making strategic supply chain decisions. The results demonstrate how supply chain network designs that over emphasize profit may include inexpensive supply chain components with high disruption risk. Therefore, more attention must be paid to managing potential disruptions and designing supply chain networks that balance profit and risk. We discuss tradeoffs among multiple design solutions and identify opportunities for future research. Copyright © 2014 IGI Global.},

abstract={The insights that firms gain from big data analytics (BDA) in real time is used to direct, automate and optimize the decision making to successfully achieve their organizational goals. Data management (DM) and advance analytics (AA) tools and techniques are some of the key contributors to making BDA possible. This paper aims to investigate the characteristics of BD, processes of data management, AA techniques, applications across sectors and issues that are related to their effective implementation and management within broader context of BDA. A range of recently published literature on the characteristics of BD, DM processes, AA techniques are reviewed to explore their current state, applications, issues and challenges learned from their practice. The finding discusses different characteristics of BD, a framework for BDA using data management processes and AA techniques. It also discusses the opportunities/applications and challenges managers dealing with these technologies face for gaining competitive advantages in businesses. The study findings are intended to assist academicians and managers in effectively quantifying the data available in an organization into BD by understanding its properties, understanding the emerging technologies, applications and issues behind BDA implementation.

abstract={Humans practically measure everything in life. For any business, they measure revenue, sales, profits, earning per share, stake holders value and so forth. In HR management they measure staff attrition, cost of training per candidate, rating awarded in performance management system etc. Measurement of Effectiveness of HRD instruments namely training and development, compensation, feedback and coaching, job design, career planning etc. are required for any organization, regardless of size, industry, location or success. In this paper an attempt has been made to analyze prominent HR instruments to determine their individual measure of effectiveness and the Total Expected Utility Measure based on Multiple-Attribute Utility analysis, from both the employees’ and employers’ view point. To assign relative importance to each HRD instrument, Analytical Hierarchical Process has been used. The methodology adopted was questionnaire, to a random sample of teaching faculty in a large private university in north India. The findings indicate that the total expected utility measure is an important measure and facilitates comparing firms in the same industry, region, size, etc. Copyright © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={This research explores the mechanism by which the buyers and suppliers adopt different information technologies (IT) as they enter into buyer-supplier relationships. It further studies how buyers’ technology choices influence suppliers’technology adaptation in an Influential Adaptation model. Using empirical data collected from the Society of Manufacturing Engineer’s executives, a confirmatory factor analysis was used to improve measurement rigors including convergent validity, discriminant validity, and reliability. The Planning IT use sub-construct is developed for this study. The structural model results show that suppliers’ adoption of IT use is largely influenced by buyers’ level of IT use; however, there is no clear relationship pattern relating to suppliers’ IT use.

abstract={This paper presents a Data Envelopment Analysis approach that evaluates the relative effectiveness of decision making units (DMUs) in the presence of predetermined targets which are to be achieved simultaneously. As such targets are a core element of common performance management systems, the approach is a desirable complement of these systems. The proposed method classifies the DMUs into subsets according to their ability to meet the targets and provides a complete ranking within each subset on the basis of a measure of relative effectiveness. For that purpose, we introduce a new concept called super-effectiveness. The approach is illustrated by means of a example referring to a European pharmacy chain. Copyright © 2014 IGI Global.},

abstract={View selection deals with the selection of appropriate sets of views capable of improving the response times for queries while conforming to space constraints. Materializing all views is infeasible, as the number of possible views is exponential with respect to the number of dimensions and, thus, would not fit within the available storage space. Further, optimal view selection is an NP-Complete problem. Thus, the only remaining alternative is to select a subset of views that reduce the query response time and fit within the available space for materialization. The most fundamental greedy view selection algorithm HRUA considers the size parameter for computing the Top-K views for materialization. In each iteration, it computes the benefit, with respect to size, of all non-selected views, and selects the one entailing the highest benefit for materialization. Though these selected views may be beneficial in respect of their size, they may not be capable of answering large numbers of future queries thereby becoming an unnecessary space overhead. Existing query frequency based view selection algorithms, which address this problem, have been compared in this paper. Experimental results show that each of these algorithms, in comparison to HRUA, are able to select fairly good quality views that provide answers to comparatively greater numbers of queries. Materializing these selected views would facilitate the business decision making process. © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={Data clustering has found significant applications in various domains like bioinformatics, medical data, imaging, marketing study and crime analysis. There are several types of data clustering such as partitional, hierarchical, spectral, density-based, mixture-modeling to name a few. Among these, partitional clustering is well suited for most of the applications due to the less computational requirement. An analysis of various literatures available on partitional clustering will not only provide good knowledge, but will also lead to find the recent problems in partitional clustering domain. Accordingly, it is planned to do a comprehensive study with the literature of partitional data clustering techniques. In this paper, thirty three research articles have been taken for survey from the standard publishers from 2005 to 2013 under two different aspects namely the technical aspect and the application aspect. The technical aspect is further classified based on partitional clustering,constraint-basedpartitionalclusteringandevolutionaryprogramming-basedclusteringtechniques. Furthermore, an analysis is carried out, to find out the importance of the different approaches that can be adopted, so that any new development in partitional data clustering can be made easier to be carried out by researchers. © 2015,IGI Global.},

abstract={This article has proposed a modified Kruskal's method to increase the efficiency of a genetic algorithm to determine the path of least distance starting from a central point to solve the open vehicle routing problem. In a vehicle routing problem, vehicles start from a central point and several customers placed in different locations to serve their demands and return to the central point. In the case of the open vehicle routing problem, the vehicles do not go back to the central point after serving the customers. The challenge is to reduce the number of vehicles used and the distance travelled simultaneously. The proposed method applies genetic algorithms to find the set of customers those are covered by a particular vehicle and the authors have applied the proposed modified Kruskal's method for local routing optimization. The results of the new method are analyzed in comparison with some of the evolutionary methods. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.},

abstract={Cloud computing is a new paradigm model that offers different services to its customers. The increasing number of users for cloud services i.e. software, platform or infrastructure is one of the major reasons for security threats for customers’ data. Some major security issues are highlighted in data storage service in the literature. Data of thousands of users are stored on a single centralized place where the possibility of data threat is high. There are many techniques discussed in the literature to keep data secure in the cloud, such as data encryption, private cloud and multiple clouds concepts. Data encryption is used to encrypt the data or change the format of the data into the unreadable format that unauthorized users could not understand even if they succeed to get access of the data. Data encryption is very expensive technique, it takes time to encrypt and decrypt the data. Deciding the security approach for data security without understanding the security needs of the data is a technically not a valid approach. It is a basic requirement that one should understand the security level of data before applying data encryption security approach. To discover the data security level of the data, the authors used machine learning approach in the cloud. In this paper, a data classification approach is proposed for the cloud and is implemented in a virtual machine named as Master Virtual Machine (Vmm). Other Vms are the slave virtual machines which will receive from Vmm the classified information for further processing in cloud. In this study the authors used three (3) virtual machines, one master Vmm and two slaves Vms. The master Vmm is responsible for finding the classes of the data based on its confidentiality level. The data is classified into two classes, confidential (sensitive) and non-confidential (non-sensitive/public) data using K-NN algorithm. After classification phase, the security phase (encryption phase) shall encrypt only the confidential (sensitive) data. The confidentiality based data classification is using K-NN in cloud virtual environment as the method to encrypt efficiently the only confidential data. The proposed approach is efficient and memory space friendly and these are the major findings of this work. © 2016, IGI Global.},

abstract={Business data analytics is a process of utilizing analytic techniques for resolving business issues based on business performance data. While the avalanche of business data creates unprecedented opportunity, it also poses three fundamental challenges for analytics: (1) Business data often encounters quality issues and needs substantial cleaning efforts; (2) Business data is large in overall size but cannot be fully shared due to the concern of data security; and (3) Business data often needs to be cross-referenced with public databases to reveal more information and knowledge. Due to these challenges, the leading obstacle at many organizations is the lack of a systematic approach to understanding how to leverage the business data analytics techniques to transfer from data-rich into decision-smart. To answer this question, this article proposes a systematic step-by-step procedure for business data analytics. This proposed framework is illustrated and validated by a real case study that involves choosing an optimal location for opening of a new retail site. Copyright © 2015, IGI Global.},

abstract={In the present day, business environment marked by intense competition and uncertainties, the ability of an organization and its supply chain to respond quickly to an unforeseen change in the business environment forms the key to its sustenance in the market. Since an agile supply chain comprises of a plethora of components, it is imperative that there should be a set of uncertainties associated with its functioning. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate a set of critical risks associated with the agility of an organization’s supply chain. Identification and prioritization of the risks to assess their relative criticality form the backbone of the research process. This research is expected to aid the decision-makers develop robust risk management strategies as related to their organizational supply chain agility, thereby ensuring their growth and sustainability in the market.

abstract={Today, companies have admired that maintenance is a profitable commercial element. Therefore, its role in modern manufacturing systems has become more important. Maintenance plays a vital role in achieving organizational goals and improving indicators such as reliability, accessibility, decreasing equipment downtime, products quality, risk mitigation, productivity increase, equipment safety, etc. In this regard, maintenance and its strategies have found special importance in industry. As a result, the main aim of this research is to select the best maintenance strategy by using Fuzzy ARAS and Fuzzy ANP techniques in oil industry (Tehran Oil Refinery – Shahr-e-Ray). Since many variables (i.e. security, cost, added – value, etc.) are effective in selecting a maintenance strategy, these variables are initially identified by reviewing the relevant literature and maintenance experts’ opinions and then the best maintenance strategy is selected by using Fuzzy ARAS.

abstract={Cloud computing has been proven to have numerous benefits for organizations, especially in supply chain management. More and more organizations have adopted cloud-based solutions to be their primary sourcing applications. Nevertheless, this technology is not without challenges, and in order to deploy and implement cloud-based solutions successfully with minimal risks organizations need to have practical guidance on this emerging technology. Despite the rapid growth of cloud computing in supply chain areas, the existing literature is still conceptual, inadequate, and mainly focused on the pre-adoption stage of this technology. This research examines the post-adoption stage of cloud-based supply chain solutions from the decision science perspective and intends to provide organizations with practical guidance on how to ensure the efficiency of a cloud-based supply chain system and control risks associated with cloud-based solutions.

abstract={Given the importance of operating and managing forward and reverse supply chains in an integrated manner, this article considers an integrated four-stage supply chain network with forward and reverse product flows. We consider a closed loop supply chain (CLSC) network with primarily commercial returns, which could be potentially recovered by light repair operations or by refurbishing. The annual estimate of commercial returns in the United States is in excess of $100 billion. This paper discusses the optimal design of a CLSC network.A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to determine the optimal locations of the facilities and the distribution of flows between facilities in the CLSC to maximize the total profit. The model is illustrated using a realistic example applicable to the electronics industries. Even though recycling and refurbishing add cost, the overall supply chain profit increases due to a reduction in the raw material cost. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the effect of return percentage and varying demands of customers who are willing to buy refurbished products. The analysis show that the total supply chain profit increases with the increase in refurbishing activity. Finally, changes in the network design with respect to the uncertainty in these return parameters are also studied. The results show that the changes in return parameters lead to changes in optimal network design implying the need to explicitly consider the uncertainty in these return parameters.

abstract={Industry 4.0 is an evolutionary topic, which integrates the business with several production architectures e.g. big data analytics, autonomous networks of electronic devices, simulation, horizontal and vertical integration, the industrial internet of things, cyber security, cloud computing, additive manufacturing, virtual reality, etc. The present research aim is to quantify the research trends and contributions of industry 4.0's business architectures from years 2014-2018. The research responds to the literature review of current leading academic journals and conference proceedings, specific to IIoT-BRs such as I4-Business Growth (BG), I4-Business Optimization (BO), I4-Operational Excellence (OE), I4-Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), I4-Manufacturing Executive system (MES), I4-Process Control Network (PNC), I4-Functional Excellence (FE), I4-Business Strategy, (BS), I4-Human Resource Management (HRM), I4-Integration (I). The authors utilize an open (Google) internet-based research search engine (OIBRSE) as a conduit to acquire the digital object identifiers and universal resource locators if the DOI non-exists with research articles. The research work archives the one hundred sixty-five research articles, gleaned by conducting the literature review upon IIoT-BRs. The research results that research trends and contributions of I4-(BO) and I4-(BG) are strong. However, I4-(BO) and I4-(BG) are slightly prose than I4-(MES) and I4-Network (PNC). The research growth is a weak residue of the industry 4.0's (IIoT-BRs). The research stores the authentic evidence to supervise the researchers for current research gaps and motivates them to extend their glance to weak IIoT-BRs. The research work aids the new researchers of industry 4.0 to learn and optimize their knowledge in empire of industry 4.0 too. Copyright © 2020, IGI Global.

The paper shows that on the aggregate level the choice probabilities can be obtained using analytical closed-form solution and other approaches such as Thurstone scaling, Bradley-Terry maximum likelihood, and Markov modeling via Chapman-Kolmogorov equations for steady-states probabilities. On the individual level, to account for the exact combinations presented in each task, the Cox hazard model is employed, as well as new approaches of least squares objective for maximum difference, and maximum likelihood in order statistics.

abstract={This paper reports on the results of extracting useful information from text notes captured within a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to segment and thus target groups of customers likely to respond to cross-selling campaigns. These notes often contain text that is indicative of customer intentions. The results indicate that the notes are meaningful in classifying customers who are likely to respond to purchase multiple communication devices. A Naïve Bayes classifier outperformed a Support Vector Machine classifier for this task. When combined with structured information, the classifier performed only marginally better. Thus, customer service notes can be an important source of predictive data in CRM systems. © 2016, IGI Global.},

abstract={One way to enhance the likelihood that more university students will graduate within the specific major that they begin with is to attract the type of students who have typically (historically) done well in that field of study. This paper expands upon a study that utilizes data mining techniques to analyze the characteristics of students who enroll as actuarial students and then either drop out of the major or graduate as actuarial students. Several predictive models including logistic regression, neural networks and decision trees are obtained using input variables describing academic attributes of the students. The models are then compared and the best fitting model is determined. The regression model turns out to be the best predictor. Since this is a very well understood method, it can easily be explained. The decision tree, although its underpinnings are somewhat difficult to explain, gives a clear and well understood output. In addition, the non-predictive method of cluster analysis is applied in order to group these students into distinct classifications based on the values of the input variables. Finally, a new approach to modeling in SAS®, called Rapid Predictive Modeler (RPM), is described and utilized. The results of the RPM also select the regression model as the best predictor.

abstract={In conventional data envelopment analysis, it is assumed that the input versus output status of any particular performance measure is known. In some situations, finding the status of some variables from the input or output point of view is very difficult; these variables are treated as both inputs and outputs and are called flexible measures. In this paper, using the TOPSIS method, and also using a voting model, the status of such a variable will be determined, and the results obtained will be employed to evaluate the efficiency of homogeneous decision making units. Note that all the models used in this paper are linear programming models and there is no need to solve any integer programming model. The approach is illustrated by an example. © 2014,IGI Global.},

abstract={This research aims to select the optimum green energy sources for sustainable planning from a given set of alternatives. The study presents an integrated multi-criteria decision-making analysis-the entropy-technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS)-to evaluate the energy sources: coal, oil, gas, carbon capture; and storage: nuclear fission/power, large hydro, small hydro, wind, solar photovoltaic, concentrating solar, geothermal, and biomass. Information related to energy parameters are always imprecise; thus, to address the impreciseness of eliciting judgments in the preferences of criteria, the entropy method is used. TOPSIS method is then utilized to select the optimum sources. Results show that solar-photovoltaic is the optimum green energy source having the highest score value, and annual generation is the most prioritized criterion. Sensitivity analysis also demonstrates the robustness of the selection methodology. Copyright © 2020, IGI Global.

abstract={Logistics activities are significant energy consumers and known contributors to GHG emissions, hence optimisation of logistics energy demand is of critical importance. The onset of the fourth Industrial revolution delivers significant technological opportunities for logistics optimisation with additional benefits in logistics energy optimisation. This research propositions a business process centric logistics model based on Industry 4.0. A Logistics 4.0 architecture is developed comprising Industry 4.0 technologies and associated enablers. The Industry 4.0 architecture components are validated by conducting a Systematic Literature Review on Industry 4.0 and logistics. Applying the validated Logistics 4.0 architecture to a cyber physical logistics energy model, based on the digitalisation of business processes, a comprehensive simulation is developed identified as the Logistic 4.0 Energy Model. The model simulates the technological impact of Industry 4.0 on a logistics network. The model generates energy and CO2 emission values for “as-is” and “to-be” Industry 4.0 scenarios.

abstract={3D scanners are supporting technology which offers a higher level of flexibility to create designs for ergonomic tooling, biocompatible surgical guides, and realistic prototypes and parts. Flexibility helps to reduce lead time, weight, cost, and product development time. Scanning technologies are in tandem with support software that helps a designer to (re)design products at a cheaper and faster rate. There is a need to understand different types of flexibilities and associated application of 3D scanner. In this article, we have conducted an extensive review of the available literature for identifying various flexibilities of 3D scanners and its applications. This research categorises 3D scanner flexibility and applications into five major types. From design to final quality inspection, these flexibilities play a significant role in industries and sectors to achieve optimum performance. Ranking of these flexibilities and their impact on different applications are accomplished using the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) with the help of expert opinion. The ranking of five significant flexibilities by using 3D scanners, undertaken through the AHP technique shows that scanning provides object flexibility at a higher level. The impacts of different flexibilities on applications are also weighted, and it shows that all flexibilities are enough to achieve application individually. This digital technology is helpful to create the customised product which is also helpful to achieve goals of Industry 4.0. It facilitates the customisation and has a significant impact on the design applications. This study provides an understanding of the 3D scanner in the context of flexibilities by identifying the different flexibilities it offers when used for different applications. Findings may assist developing a decision support system for the selection of 3D scanners for the different applications. Copyright © 2020, IGI Global.

abstract={Medical industries are encountered with challenges like providing quality services to patients, correct diagnosis and effective treatments at reasonable cost. Data mining has become a necessity and provides solutions to many important and critical health related concerns. It is the process to mine knowledgeable information from voluminous medical data sets. It plays an essential role in improving medical decision making and helps to investigate trends in patient conditions which can be used by doctors for disease diagnosis. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups object with high similarity together. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) causes renal failure and kidney dysfunction. It has become an important health issue with the number of cases on the rise every year. This article presents analysis and detection of Chronic Kidney Disease using Fuzzy C Means (FCM) clustering which is effective in mining complex data having fuzzy relationships among members. FCM will investigate and group together the patients having CKD and Not CKD. The simulation and coding are done in MATLAB. © 2019, IGI Global.},

abstract={The purpose of this article is to develop a new stochastic multi objective optimization model to mitigate disruption risks while simultaneously addressing operational risks as well. Indeed, this model considers five objective functions for selecting a set of suppliers considering disruption risk and stochastic demand, quality, and delay time. The authors use two types of risk evaluation models: value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Two examples are given to illustrate our model and two solution methods are compared and tested. Copyright © 2018, IGI Global.},

abstract={This study examines the influence of Electronic Word of Mouth (eWOM) on the box office revenue generation of movies in the U.S domestic market using the technique of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) and aspect identification. The analysis was conducted on the sentiment score and frequency of five movie aspects from the user reviews collected from high grossing 2014 movies. This study revealed a significant dependence on the aspect-based sentiment frequency of the movie’s Story aspect. Surprisingly, the data also showed a strong dependence of movie success on the negative sentiment frequency on the Casting aspect. The findings of the study suggest that the eWOM present in online movie reviews can be used to predict the performance of a movie at the box office by monitoring the aspect’s frequency of sentiment, which can be referred to as a metric of the online “buzz” of the movie.

abstract={Strategic decision-making is one of the most important criteria for organizational success. Therefore, it is vital to have a well-developed decision making process in place. However, one of the greatest challenges facing organizations today is making important and timely business decisions. The focus of this study was to examine critical business intelligence input factors that influenced the decision making process. The business intelligence input factors considered were accessibility, reliability, quality of information, frequency of use, relevance, security, and quality of decisions. The results of this study show that the decision making process is very complex. Based on the analyses of the data, the findings indicate that these factors help determine reasons why managers use business intelligence technology in the decision making process. These findings will help organizations decision makers make better. This can improve the operational and strategic decision making process, thereby creating a competitive advantage for the organization.

abstract={The Nigerian banking industry, being the second largest in sub-Saharan Africa after the South-African banking industry, has evolved and undergone remarkable transformation over the years. As such, the evaluation of the Performance Measurement Systems (PMS) of banks in Nigeriabecomes highly desirable. In response, this research was undertaken to: identify the elements of PMS; investigate the appropriateness and effectiveness of PMS; and assess the interrelationship between the PMS and strategy in the Nigerian banking industry. Statistics such as charts, percentage analysis, Wilcoxon, Chi – square, Kruskal Wallis, and Mann- Whitney U tests were employed for data analyses. Following research findings that traditional financial measures were commonly used in the Nigerian banking industry, the study recommends the adoption of more innovative PMS to improve performance. Also, the inclusion of performance measures like innovation, continuous improvement, and risk management should be enshrined in the PMS of the Nigerian banking industry to strengthen monitoring.

abstract={The increasing complexity in Military Command and Control (C2) systems has led to greater vulnerability due to system availability and integrity caused by internal vulnerabilities and external threats. Several studies have proposed measures of availability and integrity for the assets in the C2 systems using precise and certain measures (i.e., the exact number of attacks on the availability and the integrity, the number of countermeasures for the availability and integrity attacks, the effectiveness of the availability and integrity countermeasure in eliminating the threats, and the financial impact of each attack on the availability and integrity of the assets). However, these measures are often uncertain in real-world problems. The source of uncertainty can be vagueness or ambiguity. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets can represent vagueness and ambiguity by formalizing inaccuracies inherent in human decision-making. In this paper, the authors extend the risk assessment literature by including fuzzy measures for the number of attacks on the availability and the integrity, the number of countermeasures for the availability and integrity attacks, and the effectiveness of the availability and integrity countermeasure in eliminating these threats. They analyze the financial impact of each attack on the availability and integrity of the assets and propose a comprehensive cyber-risk assessment system for the Military C2 in the fuzzy environment.

abstract={The aim of this study was to examine two types of time lag related to IT innovations in Japan. The first is the time lag between newspaper articles and academic papers in the past and between newspaper articles and IT innovations in the present. The second is the ongoing time lag with regard to the big data trend between the United States and Japan. This article explores a new analytical process based on two-dimensional maps proposed by Krinder et al. (2005) for visualizing and measuring time lags. After overviewing the big data trend in Japan, the author analyzed 2,910 newspaper articles and 550 academic papers published in Japan related to past innovations, as well as 734 newspaper articles from the United States and 173 from Japan related to big data innovation. The results indicate that academic research for past trends lags business trends by 1-4 years. However, time lags in the big data trend could not be captured because of the difficulty predicting the point of inflection of S-shaped curves in an early stage of innovation. Accordingly, the author simulated future S-shaped curves to show the gap between the United States and Japan. Copyright © 2014 IGI Global.},

abstract={Biometric processes are utilized for recognition and distinguishing a person for different applications. The procedure is made possible by utilizing single biometric highlight or a mix of biometric highlights. In the event that the distinguishing proof is finished by utilizing a solitary biometric highlight (confront, iris, finger, palm, and so forth) then the framework is called unimodal, and if a combnation of biometrics are utilized then it is called multimodal. In a multimodal framework compared to the different downsides of a unimodal framework (noisy data, multiple vectors and so forth) are evacuated. The fundamental objective of the proposed work is to outline a system that will give validation in view of three-level verification for a man. Prior works in this field are clarified in various factual models in view of various verification plans. In the proposed strategy, a system is created in which if one biometric attribute fails then the other biometic characteristics can be utilized for verification. © 2019, IGI Global.},

abstract={Discrete choice modeling is one of the main tools of estimation utilities and preference probabilities among multiple alternatives in economics, psychology, social sciences, and marketing research. One of popular DCM tools is the Best-Worst Scaling, also known as Maximum Difference. Data for such modeling is given by respondents presented with several items, and each respondent chooses the best alternative. Estimation of utilities is usually performed in a multinomial-logit modeling which produces utilities and choice probabilities. This article describes how to obtain probability estimation adjusted to possible absence of items in actual purchasing. We apply Markov chain modeling in the form of Chapman-Kolmogorov equations and its steady-state solution for stochastic matrix can be obtained analytically. An adjustment to choice probability with network effects is also considered. Numerical example by marketing research data is used. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.},

abstract={This article presents a restricted maximum likelihood-based algorithm to estimate who influences whose opinions and to what degree when agents share their opinions over large online social networks such as Twitter. The proposed algorithm uses multi-core processing and distributed computing to provide a scalable solution as the optimization problems are large in scale; a network with 10,000 agents and average connectivity of 100 requires estimates of about 1 million parameters. A computational study is then used to show that the estimates are efficient and robust when the full rank conditions for the covariance matrix are met. The results also highlight the importance of the quantity of the information being shared over the social network for the inference of the influence structure. Copyright © 2018, IGI Global.

abstract={This article describes how magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems play a crucial role in radiology, specifically in the diagnosis of diseases and management of patient treatment. The objective of this article is to present MRI technicians' perspective on the relative importance of the required factors when selecting and purchasing an MRI system. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology was used to determine the relative priorities for different criteria along with the consistency of responses. A set of criteria for MRI system were identified based on the literature and interviews with experts (i.e., MRI technicians), and organized into a rational hierarchical framework consisting of the five main criteria and nineteen sub-criteria. An online survey including demographic questions was conducted to identify the relative weights of these criteria. Survey responses from 87 technicians indicate that brand is found to be the most important criteria, followed by patient comfort, usability, technical issues, and performance. Among the sub-criteria, the highest weights are assessed for country of origin, user-friendly independent workstation, reputation, software support. The findings demonstrate the factors that can be critical discriminators between different MRI systems. Copyright © 2018, IGI Global.},

abstract={Much of the research in data mining and knowledge discovery has focused on the development of efficient data mining algorithms. Researchers and practitioners have developed data mining techniques to solve diverse real-world data mining problems. But there is no single source that identifies which techniques solve what problems and how, the advantages and limitations, and real-life use-cases. Lately, identifying data mining techniques and corresponding problems that they solve has drawn significant attention. In this paper, the author describes the progress made in developing data mining techniques and then classify them in terms of data mining problems taxonomy to help assist practitioners in using appropriate data mining techniques that solve business problems. This will allow researchers to expand the body of knowledge in this discipline. This article proposes a data mining problems taxonomy based on data mining techniques being used. Prominent data mining problems include classification, optimization, prediction, partitioning, relationship, pattern matching, recommendation, ranking, sequential patterns and anomaly detection. The data mining techniques that are used to solve these data mining problems in general fall under top 10 data mining algorithms. Copyright © 2018, IGI Global.},

abstract={Energy saving and emission reduction are increasingly important. This paper studies a two-stage network based on the DEA-SBM model to study the two aspects. This study evaluates their efficiency, including benchmarks for improvement, of 27 regions in China from 2009 to 2013. First, the efficiency of each DMU in each stage can be obtained by the proposed model. Second, by combining the two stages, the integrated efficiency of each region can be calculated. The regions are also grouped geographically. The empirical results show that: (i)Beijing and Tianjin are the best in terms of energy system, while Gansu and Ningxia perform best in terms of environment system. (ii)From the perspective of geographical area in China, the eastern area are the best for stage one, while the western area is the best for stage two. (iii)In terms of integrated efficiency, the western area performs worst. Copyright © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is widely used customer driven process for product development. Thus, Customer Requirements (CRs) play a key role in QFD process. However, the diversification in marketplace makes these CRs more dynamic and changing, giving rise the need to forecast CRs to improve competitiveness and increase customer satisfaction. The purpose can be served by using Data Mining techniques of forecasting. With the pool of forecasting techniques available, it is important to evaluate a suitable one for more effective results. To this end, the paper presents a novel software tool to efficiently forecast CRs in QFD. The tool allows for forecasting using various data mining based time series analysis techniques that strongly assists in doing comparative analysis and evaluating out the most apt technique for forecasting of CRs. The tool is developed using VB.Net and MS-Access. Finally, an example is presented to demonstrate the practicability of proposed software tool. © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={Although supply chain (SC) integration is well discussed in literature, there is a missing link in its multi-faceted nature, in terms of implementation, at the empirical level. Existing empirical research focus has largely been on examining the impact of SC integration (SCI) on business performance while other issues such as barriers and enablers of SCI have mostly been conceptual. This study was thus set to examine the manner in which firms pursue integration; and how resources, competences, experience, and industry-type influence this course. Using questionnaires, data were collected from 117 service and manufacturing firms operating in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The contribution of this study lies in its ability to critically examine how SCI is pursued and providing validations to the root barriers/enablers of SCI from a contextual standpoint. The findings of the study do not only fill the void in literature but also offer invaluable directions to practitioners and researchers. © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={Clustering techniques typically group similar instances underlying individual attributes by supposing that similar instances have similar attributes characteristic. On contrary, clustering similar instances given a specific behavior is framed through supervised learning. For instance, which fashion products have similar behavior in term of sales. Unfortunately, conventional clustering methods cannot tackle this case, since they handle attributes by a same manner. In fact, conventional clustering approaches do not consider any response, and moreover they assume attributes act by the same importance. However, clustering instances with respect to responses leads to a better data analytics. In this research, the authors introduce an approach for the goal supervised clustering and show its advantage in terms of data analytics as well as prediction. To verify the feasibility and the performance of this approach the authors conducted several experiments on a real dataset derived from an apparel industry. Copyright © 2016, IGI Global.},

abstract={Temporal association rule mining is a data mining technique in which relationships between items which satisfy certain timing constraints can be discovered. This paper presents the concept of temporal association rules in order to solve the problem of classification of inventories by including time expressions into association rules. Firstly, loss profit of frequent items is calculated by using temporal association rule mining algorithm. Then, the frequent items in particular time-periods are ranked according to descending order of loss profits. The manager can easily recognize most profitable items with the help of ranking found in the paper. An example is illustrated to validate the results. Copyright © 2016, IGI Global.},

However, very few attention has been paid to effectively validating or calibrating the prediction results. The focus of this paper is to present a dynamic modeling and validation framework for the market direction prediction. The central idea is to calibrate the probabilistic prediction by estimating two conditional probabilities of correct forecast from the dynamic validation data set. The calibration method can be combined with any predictive model that generates probabilistic prediction of the market direction. Copyright © 2015, IGI Global.},

abstract={Prior research has devoted considerable attention to consumer hedonic experience and customer satisfaction in retailing and online shopping settings. However, very little effort has been made to investigate the relationship between hedonic experience and customer satisfaction in the context of information system use. To fill this gap, this study investigates the effect of hedonic experience on game player satisfaction using an adapted technology acceptance model. By doing so, this article addresses the core research question: What drives online game player satisfaction? In support of the model and most of the hypotheses, the empirical results not only identify key antecedents of enjoyment and perceived usefulness, but also confirm the significant role of the two constructs in predicting player satisfaction. This study thus helps both information systems and marketing researchers attain a better understanding of customer satisfaction, expand their baseline knowledge of hedonic experience constructs, and conduct more fruitful and illuminating future research on e-commerce service.

abstract={Many different metrics have been developed to measure the capacity for resilience to a disaster event. In order to track the dynamic response of a community in the aftermath of a disaster, however, it is necessary to consider measures that vary over time and for which data points are actually available on a relatively frequent basis. Unemployment, construction GDP, leisure and hospitality GDP, manufacturing GDP and information and communication technology GDP are all examples of measures which provide the opportunity to quantitatively assess the relative rate and extent of community recovery at regular time intervals following a disaster. By quantitatively analyzing the relative amount of resilience exhibited by a community we may gain better insight into its ability to recover, and thus develop a better understanding of the factors that allow it to return to normal levels of activity. The authors apply their analytical approach to compare the communities of New Orleans, Louisiana and Gulfport, Mississippi in the context of Hurricane Katrina. Copyright © 2014 IGI Global.},

abstract={Buildings consume about 40% of the total energy in most countries contributing to a significant amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and global warming. Therefore, reducing energy consumption in buildings, making buildings more energy efficient and operating buildings in more energy efficient manner are important tasks in today’s world. Analytics can play an important role in identifying energy saving opportunities in buildings by modeling and analyzing how energy is consumed in buildings. In this paper, a set of analytics which can assist building owners, facility managers, operators and tenants of buildings in assessing, benchmarking, diagnosing, tracking, forecasting, simulating and optimizing energy consumption is presented.

abstract={The association of Industry 4.0 and supply chain management assures tremendous growth and developmental opportunities towards manufacturing organizations. The two aspects (Industry 4.0 and supply chain management) are one of the most opted choices for research among academicians and researchers. The study in question accommodates 884 papers from past 10 years, which contributes towards Industry 4.0, supply chain management, cyber-physical systems, digitization, Internet of Things, and Big Data predictive analytics. The statistical tools include BibExcel and Gephi for bibliometric and network analysis. The results are presented in the form of top contributing authors, keywords, and citations. The article also shares a conceptual model based on the review of studies. The findings will help managers or officials to understand the importance of Industry 4.0 and its association with supply chain management. The formed clusters and their associations are providing new areas that require managerial attention. The article ends while discussing the current and future scope of research.

abstract={To cope up with the ever-changing dynamic business environment, every organization needs to reinvent their marketing mix strategies by introducing some innovations and novel strategic changes. These transformations are very important for the organizational growth, survival and expansion. These transitions could be the need of the hour or a strategic move towards a brighter future. Several ecommerce players are already scaling up their offline presence to let customers experience the product before buying and to reach a larger market. Myntra is planning to be one of them by opening its physical stores across India to boost its private labels. The case attempts to examine those factors which prompted Myntra to sail against the tide. In spite of touching such heights in the online world in a short time span of just a decade is Myntra not convinced about the customer satisfaction and thus, reverting back to traditional retail.

abstract={This article concerns a green Time Dependent Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (TDCVRP) which is confronted in urban distribution planning. The problem is formulated as a Markovian Decision Process and a dynamic programming (DP) approach has been used for solving the problem. The article presents a performance comparison of two recent heuristics for the green TDCVRP that explicitly accounts for time dependent vehicle speeds and fuel consumption (emissions). These heuristics are the classical Restricted Dynamic Programming (RDP) algorithm, and the Simulation Based RDP that consists of weighted random sampling, RDP heuristic and simulation. The numerical experiments show that the Simulation Based Restricted Dynamic Programming heuristic can provide promising results within relatively short computational times compared to the classical Restricted Dynamic Programming for the green TDCVRP.

abstract={Behavioural finance has gained research interest among researchers because of investor behavior and market anomalies. Investor behaviour varies with demographics and geographic characteristics. Further, investor behavior towards a gold exchange trade fund is gaining research interest due to various factors. Not much research has been carried out in this direction, with the exception of some comparisons. Therefore, the performance of a gold exchange traded fund needs to be assessed from the investor behavior perspective. Additionally, the investors behavior contains uncertainties. Thus, there is a need for intelligent techniques for identifying the investors behavior despite the presence of uncertain behavioral characteristics. Therefore, to study uncertain behavior characteristic in gold exchange traded fund, in this article the authors employ a fuzzy rough set. They employ fuzzy rough quick reduct algorithm to find the superfluous attributes. Further decision rules are generated to identify the chief feature of investors’ behavior towards gold exchange traded fund. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.},

abstract={In wireless sensor networks, repairing partitions is of high priority. Various methods have been proposed for detecting partitions in the networks. One approach for reconnecting a partitioned network is to repair partitions using mobile nodes. For reconnecting the partitions approaches like transmission range adjustment and message ferry methods have been proposed but these are based on the degree of connectivity with neighbors. In the proposed method, we consider a partition detection system where the base station knows the position of the sensor nodes and the base station communicates with the nodes at regular intervals. The failure of the base station to communicate with a group of sensor nodes located together is the proof that some partitions have occurred. There could be two or more partitions occurring at a time and so multiple mobile nodes are to be employed. The aim of the algorithm is to coordinate among the mobile nodes and the partitioned network and to reconnect the partition. Here the safety of nodes, security of the network and scalability are considered. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.},

abstract={Nowadays, one of the most significant concerns is regarding to air pollution. Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is the main pollutant that is warming Earth. Industrialized countries have worked to reduce levels of sulfur dioxide, smog, and smoke in order to improve people's health. The problem of air pollution in the metropolises of Iran has been increased. The identification and development of clean fuels and also alternative fuels can play an important role in solving pollution problem. In this article, to find best fuel in terms of economic, social and environmental aspects which are part of sustainability. So, the multi-criteria decision-making techniques like fuzzy hierarchy analysis method and PROMETHEE used to rank and determine the preferred option for alternative fuels used in high-speed buses in Tehran. The results show that the biodiesel was selected as the best fuel to prevent the air pollution emission among the available options. Copyright © 2018, IGI Global.},

abstract={This paper studies the impact of consumers’ individual attitudes towards load shifting in electricity consumption in an electricity market that includes a single electricity provider and multiple consumers. A Stackelberg game model is formulated in which the provider uses price discounts over a finite number of periods in order to induce incentives for consumers to shift their peak period loads to off-peak periods. The equilibrium outcomes are investigated and the analytical results are derived for this type of market, where not only the response behaviors of independent consumers are diverse but also an individual consumer’s valuation of electricity consumption varies across periods. The obtained results demonstrate that consumer sensitivities to price discounts significantly impact price discounts and load-shifts, which are not necessarily monotonic. The authors also observe that a diverse market leads to lower peak-to-average values and provider payoffs compared to a homogenous market unless the latter one is composed of consumers with relatively lower inconvenience costs during the peak periods.

The program R was used to obtain tweets that included the word ‘insurance’ in combination with other natural disaster words (e.g., snow, ice, flood, etc.). Tweets related to six top Canadian insurance companies as well as the top five insurance companies from the rest of the world, including the new entrant Google Insurance, was collected for this study. A total of 11,495 natural disaster tweets and 19,318 insurance company tweets were analyzed using association rule mining. The authors’ analysis identified several strong rules that have implications for insurance products and services. These findings show the potential text mining applications offer for insurance companies in designing their products and services. © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={The number of educational courses offered online is growing, with students often having no choice for alternative formats. However, personal characteristics may affect online academic performance. In this study, the authors apply two business analytics methods - multiple linear/polynomial regression and generalized additive modeling (GAM) - to predict online student performance based on six personal characteristics. These characteristics are: communication aptitude, desire to learn, escapism, hours studied, gender, and English as a Second Language. Survey data from 168 students were partitioned into training/validation sets and the best fit models from the training data were tested on the validation data. While the regression method outdid the GAM at predicting student performance overall, the GAM explained the performance behavior better over various predictor intervals using natural splines. The study confirms the usefulness of business analytics methods and presents implications for college administrators and faculty to optimize individual student online learning.

abstract={Document retrieval plays a crucial role in retrieving relevant documents. Relevancy depends upon the occurrences of query keywords in a document. Several documents include a similar key terms and hence they need to be indexed. Most of the indexing techniques are either based on inverted index or full-text index. Inverted index create lists and support word-based pattern queries. While full-text index handle queries comprise of any sequence of characters rather than just words. Problems arise when text cannot be separated as words in some western languages. Also, there are difficulties in space used by compressed versions of full-text indexes. Recently, one of the unique data structure called wavelet tree has been popular in the text compression and indexing. It indexes words or characters of the text documents and help in retrieving top ranked documents more efficiently. This paper presents a review on most recent efficient indexing techniques used in document retrieval. Copyright © 2016, IGI Global.},

abstract={Stock price forecasting is a classic problem facing analysts. Forecasting models have been developed for predicting individual stocks and stock indices around the world and in numerous industries. According to a literature review, these models have yet to be applied to the restaurant industry. Strategies for forecasting typically include fundamental and technical variables. In this research, fundamental and technical inputs were combined into an artificial neural network (ANN) stock prediction model for the restaurant industry. Models were designed to forecast 1 week, 4 weeks, and 13 weeks into the future. The model performed better than the benchmark methods, which included, an analyst prediction, multiple linear regression, trading, and Buy and Hold trading strategies. The prediction accuracy of the ANN methodology presented reached accuracy performance measures as high as 60%. The model also shown resiliency over the housing crisis in 2008.

abstract={This paper employs the probabilistic composition of preferences to classify stores by their operationalefficiency. Probabilistic composition of preferences is a multicriteria analysis methodology based on the transformation of assessments by multiple attributes into probabilities of choice. The numerical initial measurements provide estimates for location parameters of probability distributions that are compared to measure the preferences. The probabilities of choice according to each attribute separately are aggregated according to probabilistic composition rules. A classification of two sets of stores into five classes is performed.

abstract={U.S. regions are expected to follow the national trend towards investment in renewable energy as part of their electricity portfolio. The progress of energy portfolios that typically involves traditional methods, such as centralized nuclear and coal-fired generation, and towards cleaner- and renewable-source generation will impact economic growth and public health. Renewable electricity production must strike a balance among cost, reliability, and compatibility. The economic and health benefits obtained from developing an efficient energy portfolio make renewable energy alternatives an important consideration for regions endowed with natural resources. A portfolio mix of production method that considers the economic benefits while limiting adverse health and environmental impacts is attractive. This research proposes a System Dynamics simulation framework to support policy-making efforts in assessing the impact of energy portfolios. The authors demonstrate the utility of the framework by means of analyzing data that pertain to the U.S. Hampton Roads - Peninsula Region. Copyright © 2015, IGI Global.},

abstract={In data analysis, when data are unattainable, it is common to select a closely related attribute as a proxy. But sometimes substitution of one attribute for another is not sufficient to satisfy the needs of the analysis. In these cases, a classification model based on one dataset can be investigated as a possible proxy for another closely related domain's dataset. If the model's structure is sufficient to classify data from the related domain, the model can be used as a proxy tree. Such a proxy tree also provides an alternative characterization of the related domain. Just as important, if the original model does not successfully classify the related domain data the domains are not as closely related as believed. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating datasets as proxies along with three cases that demonstrate the methodology and the three types of results. Copyright © 2015, IGI Global.},

abstract={Due to the recent trends of chip-miniaturization, the performance of a single-core is plateauing and hence, improving the performance of serial-execution based legacy code has become challenging. Since the expansion in power system operation continues to increase the number of contingencies to be examined, serial execution platforms present a crucial bottleneck in analyzing sufficiently large number of contingencies within a reasonably small time for performing power-system stability analysis. This paper presents an approach to parallelize power system contingency analysis over multicore processors using Chapel language. To achieve load-balancing for avoiding wastage of computation resources, the authors use efficient work-stealing scheduling. They discuss the important features of Chapel and design choices which enable us to achieve high performance gains. The approach is evaluated using hundreds of contingencies of a large 13029-bus power system. The authors compare the performance of serial-execution with that obtained using 2, 4, 8 and 16 threads. The simulation results have shown that the approach outperforms a conventional scheduling technique, namely master-slave scheduling and also scales effectively with increasing number of threads. It is believed that the performance gains obtained from the approach would be highly useful for control center operators in analyzing a large number of contingencies and thus taking suitable corrective and preventive action against catastrophic events. Also, the insights gained from these experiments will be useful in several business enterprises. Copyright © 2015, IGI Global.},

abstract={In order to meet the needs of different customer segments, manufacturers use multiple distribution channels. This paper will examine two of the most common types of multi-channel structures. Under Structure 1, a supply chain includes a manufacturer, its online store and its own retail store, like GAP’s business model. A profit maximization model is used to obtain optimal strategies in terms of optimal retail price and level of value-added services provided by manufacturer-owned retailer. Under Structure 2, a supply chain includes a manufacturer, its online store and an independent retail store, like Dell’s business model. Stackelberg game is applied to obtain the optimal retail price, wholesale price, and level of value-added services provided by an independent retailer. Furthermore, comparisons between these two business structures are discussed and managerial guidelines are proposed. Finally, numerical examples are provided and real business examples are discussed to illustrate and justify the theoretical results. © 2015,IGI Global.},

abstract={Numerous innovative technologies are available to assist the struggling hardwood lumber industry adapt to changing market demands and environmental concerns. However, most mill owners do not utilize automated lumber systems because they do not realize how substantial volume and value gains can be. Thus, there is a need to quantify improved efficiencies while also providing reliable information about how these measures translate into profitability for the mill. This study highlights new hardwood sawmill technologies, specifically in the areas of information systems and visualization technologies, and assesses the environmental impacts alongside the practicality of widespread application. Results from on-site testing were combined with other research in the field, concluding that properly applying visualization, optimization, and information technologies across the manufacturing process can significantly improve overall yield values. Combining engineering technologies with IS and strategic supply chain management leads to reduced waste and increased profits, benefiting local economies and forest resources across the globe.

abstract={Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has come under criticism that it is capable of handling only the deterministic input/output data, and therefore, efficiency scores reported by DEA may not be realistic when the data contain random error. Several researchers in the past have addressed this issue by proposing Stochastic DEA models. Some others, citing imprecise data, have proposed Fuzzy DEA models. This paper proposes a method to randomize efficiency scores in DEA by treating each score as an ‘order statistic’ that follows a Beta distribution, and it uses Thompson et al.’s (1996) DEA model appended with Assurance Regions (AR) randomized by our “uniform sampling”. In an application to a set of banks, the work demonstrates the randomization and derives some statistical results. Copyright © 2014 IGI Global.},

abstract={This study attempts to explore whether and how stock market responds to industrial accidents. We employ the event study method to look into the responses of stock markets to 83 accidents experienced by various listed companies in China, and explore how industrial accidents influence stock market in the different markets. Findings imply that the stock market shows negative reaction with respect to these accidents. However, as time goes by, the market reaction tapers off. In the bear market, the negative market reaction was highly significant. Small-sized companies, in comparison with other companies, have a most significant reaction to accidents and they also have the worst ability to recover from accidents. The findings of this study can help the investors to better understand how the stock market reacts to the industrial accidents in different market environments and under other conditions. © 2014,IGI Global.},

abstract={This study identifies various technical requirements for business analytics applications designed and optimized for mobile devices. Such applications would enable the mobile workforce to gain business insights regardless of their physical locations. In order for the mobile workforce to be efficient and effective, they need to be able to use the browsers and applications designed specifically for the mobile devices to access data, similar to desktop computers. Based on the research, such factors as online and off-line data analysis capabilities, data visualization capabilities, and security issues appear to be important factors to be addressed carefully by developers.

abstract={In response to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, many aspects of day-to-day life were considerably altered. Professional sports leagues, educational institutions, public worship, and workplace closures were commonplace. Quarantines and lockdowns put public life on hold due to social distancing requirements. As a result, internet users increased their web activity as a way of staying connected and passing the time. In this manuscript, streaming activity on Facebook Gaming, YouTube Gaming, Mixer, and Twitch is analyzed to discover changes in consumption. It is compared to school closures and stay-at-home orders in US states to better understand changes in social media platform utilization during the global pandemic. This helps to provide insights into user patterns that firms can consider in planning their future social media efforts. © 2021, IGI Global.

abstract={Disaster is the sudden problem of the world. There is no time bound. By disaster, all the creatures of the earth are affected. Here, the authors have tried to show some issues which are related to the natural calamities and green transportation. The main investigation of the paper is to describe about humanitarian supply chain management with optimized transportation cost, time, and carbon emission. Here a real-life problem of flood affected area has been chosen. When such disasters happen, quick response can reduce the devastation and save lives, and thus, it requires fulfilling the basic humanitarian needs of the affected population. In such case, organizations should also maintain the emission of the vehicles in safe range to mitigate the further disaster by pollution. A multi-objective solid transportation problem considering cost, time, and emission has been presented here. To solve the problem, this paper has used goal programming method and pareto optimal solution method. A comparison of results is also shown later. Some managerial insights are drawn to describe the situation. Copyright © 2021, IGI Global.

abstract={This research presents a novel integrated mathematical programming model for green healthcare supply network design. A multi-graph integrated supply network was designed to meet real-world situations. Minimizing total cost and minimizing delivery time are considered as the objective functions. Since the considered problem is np-hard and the presented mathematical model is very complex and highly constrained, an innovative non-dominated ranked genetic algorithm (NRGA) called M-NRGA is developed to solve the real word problems. Three different selection procedures were implemented to improve the quality and diversity of solutions in the Pareto-front resulted from M-NRGA. Several numerical examples and a case study are solved to validate the model and performance evaluation of the solution algorithm. Four different performance metrics are implemented for performance evaluation of the solution algorithm. The quality of resulted solutions, the diversity of the solutions in the Pareto front are calculated for evaluation. The results are compared with two other meta-heuristic algorithms. © 2021 IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Contemporary multinationals exist in a dynamic digital age in which business units direct enormous attention to technological solutions and business challenges, especially logistics. Business units aim for solutions that are relatively effective to implement, in relation to solving business challenges ensuring sustainability. This research seeks to present value add relative to business process optimisation model based on 4IR (Fourth Industrial Revolution) implementations, specific to multinational logistics optimisation. The onset of the 4IR has advanced businesses significantly, specifically to logistics optimisation. This article assumes a business process-centric modelling approach via industry 4.0 implementations to model and predicts the optimum logistics execution time. This is facilitated based on defined scenarios with all potential variables affecting configured sets of logistics business functions. The results address the present gap related to presenting a process-centric and systemic architecture effective to simulate the impact of change on a business. Copyright © 2020, IGI Global.

abstract={Effective logistics management plays a crucial role in the railway industry for transporting goods and people. There is a need to improve the railway infrastructure to meet today's increasing demand for railway transportation. Digitalising the railways help improve the old dilapidated infrastructure which could cause train delays in railway logistics. Interlocking testing is a priority, requiring stringent procedures guided by rail safety regulations. Historically interlocking testing required significant protocols and effort resulting in expensive resource allocation in the form of personnel, equipment, and time. This study examines modernised technology that presents the new configuration setup and improves processes that can potentially replace traditional methods. The findings of this study prove that the use of this new technology in railways can significantly reduce the amount of time spent on this process, increase the reliability, and save on human resources.

abstract={Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are one of the most widely used techniques for generalization, classification, and optimization. ANNs are inspired from the human brain and perform some abilities automatically like learning new information and making new inferences. Back-propagation (BP) is the most common algorithm for training ANNs. But the processing of the BP algorithm is too slow, and it can be trapped into local optima. The meta-heuristic algorithms overcome these drawbacks and are frequently used in training ANNs. In this study, a new generation meta-heuristic, the Social Spider (SS) algorithm, is adapted for training ANNs. The performance of the algorithm is compared with conventional and meta-heuristic algorithms on classification benchmark problems in the literature. The algorithm is also applied to real-world data in order to predict the production of a factory in Kayseri and compared with some regression-based algorithms and ANNs models. The obtained results and comparisons on classification benchmark datasets have shown that the SS algorithm is a competitive algorithm for training ANNs. On the real-world production dataset, the SS algorithm has outperformed all compared algorithms. As a result of experimental studies, the SS algorithm is highly capable for training ANNs and can be used for both classification and regression. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.

abstract={Global warming has become one of the most critical issues in the recent years. There is a great debate, centered on greenhouse gas emissions of countries, companies, and institutions. Not only the manufacturing sector but also service sector has begun to be questioned in terms of the need for controlling greenhouse gases. Thus, banks deserve an attention on the basis of sustainability and environmental impact. Besides the operational activities of this enormous sector, its investing and lending choices have considerable influence on sustainability. The carbon footprint measurement indicators have to be standardized in order to estimate the contributions of the banks in the global climate change precisely. In this study, carbon footprint measurement indicators, extracted from the sustainability reports and/or websites of the banks in Turkey are examined. The findings have been comparatively discussed with the measurements used by the international banks and addressed in the literature. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.

abstract={Powerful computational capabilities and resource availability at a low cost is the utmost demand for high performance computing. The resources for computing can viewed as the edges of an interconnected grid. It can attain the capabilities of grid computing by balancing the load at various levels. Since the nature of resources are heterogeneous and distributed geographically, the grid computing paradigm in its original form cannot be used to meet the requirements, so it can use the capabilities of the cloud and other technologies to achieve the goal. Resource heterogeneity makes grid computing more dynamic and challenging. Therefore, in this article the problem of scalability, heterogeneity and adaptability of grid computing is discussed with a perspective of providing high computing, load balancing and availability of resources. © 2019, IGI Global.},

abstract={This article attempts to develop a model by integrating interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and quality function deployment (QFD) methodology by establishing the relationship between the Indian retail service quality dimensions and service quality enablers. The integrated approach is employed to translate customers’ requirements/needs into specific service design factors/requirements in the Indian retail context. The retail service quality dimensions are identified using factor analysis and are considered as the customer demands in QFD process. Thirteen retail enablers were identified through an extensive literature survey and expert opinions. The enablers identified for the study were treated as design requirement for employing quality function deployment (QFD) in order to prioritize the design requirements. The results found showed that retail enablers ‘Image of the Store’ and ‘Value Conscious Consumers’ can be emphasized more in a priority basis by the Indian retailers followed by retail enablers ‘Location of store’ and ‘Globalization/Competition’.

abstract={Sentiment analysis manages the computational treatment of conclusion, notion, and content subjectivity. In this article, three sentiment classes such as positive, negative and neutral emotions have been demonstrated by appropriate features from raw unstructured data followed by data preprocessing steps. Applying best in class social analytics methodology to examine the sentiments embedded with purchaser remarks, encourages both producer and individual customers. Machine learning methods such as Naïve Bayes, maximum entropy classification, Deep Neural Networks were used upon the data, extracted from some websites such as Samsung and Apple for sentiment classification. In the online business arena, the application of sentiment classification explores a great opportunity. The subsidy of such an investigation is that associations can apply the proposed social examination framework to exploit the entire social information on the web and therefore improve their proper blueprint promoting strategies corresponding business.

abstract={This article describes how in order to prioritize the risks for a large number of assets, various criteria are used for ranking the asset risk. Since the criteria used for developing the risk rank is a mixture of quantitative and qualitative, a method was required to handle both the quantitative and qualitative criteria with varying scales that can be used for the electrical industry's assets. This article proposes a hybrid multi-criteria decision model (MCDM) that combines both weighted sum model (WSM) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The hybrid model is then applied to the strategic asset management plan for the electric power industry for ranking the assets risk. In this application, a large number of criteria reflecting asset conditions with their numerical values are available for which WSM method worked quite efficiently. The AHP method was applied to the criteria where qualitative criteria were available. Both methods were then synthesized, and the proposed hybrid method was formulated which resulted in a computationally efficient outcome with robust mathematical framework. The results show that the proposed method exhibited optimal results for the electric industry's asset where qualitative criteria are for AHP method was limited to 3 to 5. In the case of WSM, a larger number of quantitative criteria could be accommodated although for the application only six criteria were utilized. Copyright © 2018, IGI Global.},

abstract={Revenue management is the art and science of making the right product or service available to the right customer at the right time through the right channel at right price. Dynamic pricing plays a crucial role in the implementation of revenue management in passenger airline reservation system. The liberalization of domestic aviation sector in countries such as India has seen many new market entrants resulting in higher competition while setting the flight fares. The variation in flight fares of Delhi – Mumbai passenger airline sector is studied for a departure date based on the number of days in advance the booking is made. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses of the fares reveal the impact of airlines, booking channels and departure time windows on the pricing decisions of flight fares. The analysis framework of this study could be used as a basis for a continuous tracking study of flight fares by airline revenue managers to help them arrive at the right fare for each fare class of a flight.

abstract={In marketing one of the most common important tasks is to assign campaigns to sets of customers. These sets of customers, the target groups, consist of persons with similar properties, for example a high buying affinity for a certain product. Database marketers would not only assign a campaign by general economic or promotional consideration, but they take into account learning from databases by algorithms. The basic assumptions are already determined clusters to which campaigns, representing the products, should be assigned. The assignment can be done in the most optimal way by formal optimization, which is usually stochastic due to unknown campaign success in the future. The authors model the financial risk of the campaign success for enterprise practice. Their proposal is to use triangular distributions, known from financial and supply chain management applications. In an example, they demonstrate the benefits of the proposed procedure for the marketing task. © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={The process of collecting information is worthless if it doesn’t benefit the firm or serve any purpose. Management information systems(MIS) involve the use of set of protocols which are applied on data/information to generate intelligent business solutions. This study reviews the role of MIS in cloud computing and the impact it has globally. MIS products and cloud companies have been researched in detail. In this regard, some of the world’s top cloud based service firms have been reviewed thoroughly, including their workforce resources. Additionally, new and upcoming MIS product details have been explored along with their launching dates. It is important to note that cloud services as old as 20 years have also been discussed in this review. Discussions have been made with reference to MIS need, problems and products to solve these problems. Currently, MIS along with cloud computing is unfolding vague patterns, inventing new ideas and ensuring business success. Since cloud computing is the future of internet, the paper provides insights to the future of cloud giants and impact of these globally. Copyright © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={Search engines acts as an intermediate between the user and web. It takes the user query as input and retrieves the pages based on query terms from its database, which is in advance populated from World Wide Web. It then applies some ranking algorithm to sort the retrieved pages and presents the results back to the user in the form of millions of web pages. But most of pages in the result are not useful to the user. This problem arises because the search engine retrieves the results based on query keywords only and no attention is paid in incorporating the user interest during the ranking process. Due to the lack of automatic mechanism for tracking user browsing patterns, user seldom gets the relevant results in the top ten links. So, in order to cater the need of individual user, an automatic user interest mining technique for retrieving quality data is being proposed here. The mechanism provides the satisfactory results to the user as each user interest is maintained separately without any hassle at the user end. Copyright © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={This paper deals with service lines that serve groups of customers that differ in their service processes, but have similarities regarding the service capabilities of the specific servers. This paper optimizes the problem of allocating work elements with various learning slopes to servers to minimize the system waiting time of customers in such a line. The customer groups have a large variety of service needs. The service is organized in tandem, and the service repetitions in each group causes learning effect, but due to the nature of work, server’s learning slopes can vary. The authors propose a two stage optimization methodology: the first stage is an optimization based on a non-linear formulation for work allocation with some constraints relaxation; the second stage drops the relaxations and finds a solution that is the closest to the unconstrained solution found in the first stage. The authors show that in the presence of learning, the optimal system waiting time requires assigning different workloads to different servers. This difference depends on the number of cycles of a customer group, the server’s learning slope, and the server’s location along the line. The savings in the optimal system waiting time due to the imbalanced loading of work over the balanced load case are demonstrated. © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={The competitive organizations are struggling to develop their technology to stay ahead of others. Most of the organizations are unable to bring their technology to market due to the constraints and implications to the organizations’ performance. This problem halts the technology’s entrance into the market and most of the developed technology will be kept in the organization’s technology vault, unused, eventually becoming obsolete. The critical contradiction is the development of new technologies to improve its competitive level, yet feasibility hinders the products to be introduced to the market. The outcome from solving this contradiction is to provide more systematic, effective and faster ways for technology-to-market. This paper is proposing a technology development and assessment framework for organizations to develop their technology strategically to market using a TRIZ methodology. A case study of a new technology called ‘liquid bumper’ will be presented to show the application of the proposed framework. © 2016, IGI Global.},

abstract={Stock trading, used to predict the direction of future stock prices, is a dynamic business primarily based on human intuition. This involves analyzing some non-linear fundamental and technical stock variables which are recorded periodically. This study presents the development of an ANN-based prediction model for forecasting closing price in the stock markets. The major steps taken are identification of technical variables used for prediction of stock prices, collection and pre-processing of stock data, and formulation of the ANN-based predictive model. Stock data of periods between 2010 and 2014 were collected from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and stored in a database. The data collected were classified into training and test data, where the training data was used to learn non-linear patterns that exist in the dataset; and test data was used to validate the prediction accuracy of the model. Evaluation results obtained from WEKA shows that discrepancies between actual and predicted values are insignificant. © 2016, IGI Global.},

abstract={Authors of this paper were directly involved in several data warehousing and business intelligence projects that were carried out in companies in Croatia. Based on the experience from those projects, this paper presents how those solutions were implemented — and more importantly, how they were used by managers at different levels of management. Three different companies are described, including three different implemented solutions. One company was small, one was mid-sized and one was large. All had differences in ownership and education level of managers. Implementation (technical) details are omitted, but this paper shows that managers do not always see what business intelligence can do. Furthermore, it is shown that such projects do not always have to be expensive. © 2016, IGI Global.},

abstract={This paper presents findings ofan online questionnaire survey on the perceivedimportance ofchartist/technical and fundamental analysis and the usage of Chartist Methods and Services and Valuation Techniques among stock brokers of Bombay Stock Exchange, India. Stock brokers rely more on fundamental analysis vis-à-vis technical analysis at longer forecasting horizons and rely more on technical analysis at shorter forecasting horizons. Among Chartist Methods and Services, Sentiment Indicators were most used and Chart Company or Analyst was least used by brokers. Among Valuation Techniques, Earnings Multiple Methods were most used and Dividend Discount Models were least used by brokers. Stock brokers’age correlates with usage of sentiment indicators and their gender correlates with the usage of computer graphics and services. Regarding the use of chartist / technical and fundamental analysis on seven forecasting horizons, four distinct forecasting styles among stock brokers could be identified through cluster analysis.

abstract={This paper examines the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology from a cognitive perspective. Specifically, it analyzes (a) the role of DEA scores as an overall efficiency measure and (b) to what extent the presence of DEA scores for a non-financial performance appraisal influences a posterior financial performance assessment. The study confirms that the efficiency score acts as a strong performance marker when deciding on which decision making units (DMUs) should be awarded for their non-financial performance. Furthermore, it shows that the results of the non-financial performance evaluation may act as an anchor which significantly influences a posterior financial assessment. These insights have practical consequences for planning, reporting, and controlling processes that incorporate DEA efficiency scores. © 2015,IGI Global.},

abstract={This study presents a data analytics framework that aims to analyze topics and sentiments associated with COVID-19 vaccine misinformation in social media. A total of 40,359 tweets related to COVID-19 vaccination were collected between January 2021 and March 2021. Misinformation was detected using multiple predictive machine learning models. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model was used to identify dominant topics in COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. Sentiment orientation of misinformation was analyzed using a lexicon-based approach. An independent-samples t-test was performed to compare the number of replies, retweets, and likes of misinformation with different sentiment orientations. Based on the data sample, the results show that COVID-19 vaccine misinformation included 21 major topics. Across all misinformation topics, the average number of replies, retweets, and likes of tweets with negative sentiment was 2.26, 2.68, and 3.29 times higher, respectively, than those with positive sentiment. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

abstract={The aim of the paper is to evaluate the impact of novel COVID-19 on the returns and volatility of Indian stock markets with special reference to equity investment strategies of the Bombay Stock Exchange. For the purpose of evaluating the impact, the study has applied GARCH. The research has considered a time frame from March 2015 to January 2021. Prior to implementing GARCH model, pre-estimation tests (i.e., augmented Dickey-Fuller and ARCH-Lagrange multiplier) were conducted. Outcomes clearly indicate that the returns during the crisis for all the strategy indices have been negative, which means that the COVID-19 outbreak resulted in massive losses. Additionally, 'during crisis' period showed an increase in volatility for all the strategy indices depicting that the pandemic has a long-lasting effect and will take time to fade off. This research will help the investors in the investment decision process by giving them insights about the different strategies. © 2021.},

abstract={To assess the impact of big data analytics (BDA) on company decision making, data was collected from 225 company top managers and chief data officers in charge of the BDA group to empirically test this relationship. The data represents a sample of companies which have formally implemented BDA for at least three years with varying degrees of success. Despite considerable differences from company to company, on average the results corroborated the importance of the BDA function along four dimensions (BDA tools and methods, personnel technical proficiency, company readiness, and applications quality) in supporting company decision making toward business innovation. Managers responsible for implementing BDA in their companies should seriously consider these findings to improve the likelihood of success in their projects. The results also call for the identification of other potential determinants for BDA success as a tool for company innovation, as well as potential moderators and mediators for inclusion in a more comprehensive model.

abstract={During a global pandemic like COVID-19, the success of governmental policies depends on the people’s sentiments and extended cooperation towards these policies. Therefore, this study explores the prevalent discourse in social media about different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the policies to manage and control it. Data from Twitter collected between 25 March 2020 and 1 July 2020 was used for topic modelling and sentiment analysis. Natural language processing-based text mining techniques were used for analysis. This study first identified different frequent COVID-19related topics and then analyzed how the sentiments towards these topics differ across different phases of lockdown. Further, insights into how different topics were perceived by gender and age group are also discussed in this study. Finally, this study also analyzed how daily casualty due to COVID-19 influenced the public sentiments and number of daily tweets. The study provides a robust NLP-based text mining framework to predict the people’s sentiment during COVID-19 lockdown in India. The insights presented in this study can help the authorities mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic effectively and help different agencies in the face of similar pandemics in the future.

abstract={Automated deep-sea container terminals are the main hubs to move millions of containers in today’s global supply chains. Terminal operators often decouple the landside and waterside operations by stacking containers in stacks perpendicular to the quay. Traditionally, a single automated stacking cranes (ASC) is deployed at each stack to handle containers. A recent trend is to use new configurations with more than one crane to improve efficiency. A variety of new configurations have been implemented, such as twin, double, and triple ASCs. In this paper, the authors explore and review the mixed integer programming models that have been developed for the stacking operations of these new configurations. They further discuss how these models can be extended to contemplate diverse operational constraints including precedence constraints, interference constraints, and other objective functions.

abstract={Turnover in the workplace is a significant cause of lost productivity of the organization and the root cause of the company’s performance to many employers. Managing turnover is inevitable, but making sudden changes without knowing the cause of the problem is a terrible mistake. This paper aims to develop a reliable workplace turnover prediction model using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. In the results, first, satisfaction level, last evaluation, number of projects, average monthly hours, time spent at the company, work accident, and salary are shown to increase employee turnover at the workplace, while promotion in the 5 years and sale have no influence employee turnover at the workplace. Second, for the full model, the accuracy rate is 0.976, which implies that the error rate is 0.024. Among the patients who predicted not to be left, the accuracy that would not be left was 98.57%, and the accuracy that was left was 97.36% among the patients predicted to be left.

abstract={Wind energy increasingly plays a crucial role in replacing existing systems based on fossil fuels and nuclear generators. However, skepticism about the technological feasibility, economy of scale, and operational profitability prevails. The paper aims to fill this gap by analyzing the affordability of wind energy and by exploring the optimization issue incurring during the integration process of the micro electricity grid. Focusing on locational marginal pricing (LMP) and Midwest independent system operator (MISO) data between January 2014 and December 2020, the authors find wind power generation helps decrease the system energy price after control the effect of gas price. Further, the model captures the important seasonal and uncertain characteristics of power generation and consumption over the years. They also identify and discuss the bottleneck issues of the MISO power grids. These findings provide insights into affordability and technologic integration for long-term strategic planning on green energy including pricing, seasonality, dispatch, and reliability issues.

abstract={The gigantic growth of platforms that give individuals the ability to write a review that is visible to everyone and the huge number of documents shared on the internet have triggered the researchers to try to detect if these platforms are trying to mislead and deceive people. There is a crucial need to find ways to automatically identify fake reviews and detect deceptive people or groups. The main aim of this research is to detect deception in open domain text by using a machine learning technique. Several sets of features are used to analyse the text including unigram, part of speech, and production rules. The experimental results showed that combined feature sets of (part of speech and production rules) using the support vector machine classifier achieve the best accuracy, and it clearly improves on the accuracy of the results reported in a previous study. © 2021, IGI Global.

abstract={Generally, decision making in urban planning has progressively become difficult due to the uncertain, convoluted, and multi-criteria nature of urban issues. Even though there has been a growing interest to this domain, traditional decision support systems are no longer able to effectively support the decision process. This paper aims to elaborate an intelligent decision support system (IDSS) that provides relevant assistance to urban planners in urban projects. This research addresses the use of new techniques that contribute to intelligent decision making: machine learning classifiers, naïve Bayes classifier, and agglomerative clustering. Finally, a prototype is being developed to concretize the proposition. © 2021, IGI Global.

abstract={The impact of COVID-19 on the stock markets of US, UK, and India has been analyzed. Daily market returns of the stock indices (Dow Jones Industrial Average, FTSE-100, Nifty 50 Index, and Nifty Bank Index) have been examined using paired t-test for 40 days before and after the reporting of the first case. Index performance has also been investigated for the quarter ending June 2020 along with comparative performance analysis of the indices with Nifty Bank Index. The results showed that markets have borne substantially negative returns, but they are not statistically significant. This indicates the resilience of these markets to restore to previous index levels after taking a short-term hit. This paper adds value to the literature by acting as a resource for academia as well as industry by spelling out changes in markets during this pandemic and supporting evidence from Indian banks that are catalysts of growth for businesses in uncertain times. © 2021, IGI Global.

abstract={The global financial world has been experiencing increasing complexities in the design and construct of financial instruments, wherein the average retail investors need to be well informed and aware of the risks about the evolution of financial products and financial system. The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 is evident to the fact that traditional methods of financial advisory involving the use of human intermediaries and financial advisors is not an infallible method to determine one's financial decision or risk management. Almost a decade since the crisis, the advancement of financial technology in the form of robo-advisors and the use of data and visual analytics have completely transformed the way the retail investors make their financial decisions and also in the sphere of risk management of these investors. The study qualitatively analyses the use of the use of analytics and robo-advisory in determining retail investors' financial decisions and risk management by doing a systematic and an exhaustive literature review on the latest and the past studies on the topic.

abstract={A serious constraint of data availability over flood-prone areas in India limits the potential of carrying out hydrodynamic flood modelling studies. Such difficulties are encountered because of a lack of high-resolution topography, cross-section data of the rivers, and sufficient and accurate calibration and validation data sets. The present study addresses the problems faced in performing a comprehensive 1D-2D coupled flood modelling over a flood disastrous region Jagatsinghpur, Odisha, India. The constraints faced in terms of hydraulic parameters such as water level, discharge, and geometric parameters such as river geometry are investigated. The simulations were performed for a severe flood event in 2011 that incurred heavy socio-economic losses in the district. The establishment of a modelling platform for flood simulation shall elucidate the major constraints faced in hydrodynamic modelling for such flood-prone areas with poor data availability.

abstract={Kalman filter (KF) provides optimal beta estimate with linear models where the noise covariances are known a priori. Noise covariance adaptation-based adaptive KFs (AKFs) have also been used to get these beta estimates. These AKFs suffer from one typical problem, namely inadequate noise filtering. This paper explores some new formulation of such AKFs to solve this problem in addition to applying other related existing formulations. The proposed methods have been analysed through simulation study along with empirical performance verifications through VaR backtesting, expected shortfall analysis, and in-sample performance analysis. Results show that two new and one existing AKFs are successful to provide smooth beta estimates. Copyright © 2021, IGI Global.

abstract={This article investigates the impact of data-complexity and team-specific characteristics on machine learning competition scores. Data from five real-world binary classification competitions hosted on Kaggle.com were analyzed. The data-complexity characteristics were measured in four aspects including standard measures, sparsity measures, class imbalance measures, and feature-based measures. The results showed that the higher the level of the data-complexity characteristics was, the lower the predictive ability of the machine learning model was as well. The authors’ empirical evidence revealed that the imbalance ratio of the target variable was the most important factor and exhibited a nonlinear relationship with the model’s predictive abilities. The imbalance ratio adversely affected the predictive performance when it reached a certain level. However, mixed results were found for the impact of team-specific characteristics measured by team size, team expertise, and the number of submissions on team performance. For high-performing teams, these factors had no impact on team score. © 2022 IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The COVID-19 epidemic has triggered unmatched impairment to businesses globally. There are unmeasurable financial influences in the short-term and long-term that have caused intangible destruction within businesses. This study investigates the adoption and utilization of e-business during COVID-19 by both organizations and the general populaces. The study used a questionnaire-based survey to collect data from top managers of business organizations and their clients. SPSS was used to analyze the adoption factors. The outcomes presented that embracing e-business can assist to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and can reduce the physical ways of doing business. The findings of this study will help strategy makers, companies, and officials in making better decisions on the implementation of e-business. This will reduce the rapid spread of community transmission since ordering goods and services can easily be done virtually without physical contact, which goes in line with the social distance policy and in return boosts the country’s economy. © 2022 IGI Global.

abstract={The system's functional requirements (FR) and non-functional requirements (NFR) are derived from the software requirements specification (SRS). The requirement specification is challenging in classification process of FR and NFR requirements. To overcome these issues, the work contains various significant contributions towards SRS, such as green requirements engineering (GRE), to achieve the natural language processing, requirement specification, extraction, classification, requirement specification, feature selection, and testing the quality attributes improvement of NFRs. In addition to this, the test pad-based quality study to determine accuracy, quality, and condition providence to the classification of non-functional requirements (NFR) is also carried out. The resulted classification accuracy was implemented in the MATLAB R2014; the resulted graphical record shows the efficient non-functional requirements (NFR) classification with green requirements engineering (GRE) framework. © 2021 IGI Global.

abstract={The present study aims to examine the relationship between assets quality of banks as represented by non-performing assets (NPA) and management quality. The study has used Fama-MacBeth regression approach to measure management quality, which has been considered as the primary determinant of NPA. A sample comprising of 45 scheduled commercial banks in India has been studied for a time period of 15 years (2004-2019). The findings have revealed that better quality management leads to better asset quality. Banks with above average managerial ability can reduce NPA significantly. The bank managers should focus on their role in controlling problem loans of banks and should implement more efficient monitoring and supervision process for loan portfolios. The policy makers should pay attention towards the managerial ability of banks and stress on enhancing the quality of management. Also, investors may take note of the banks that are showing good management quality because such banks can be a profitable investment avenue. © 2021 IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The area of stock market prediction has attracted a great deal of attention during the past decade especially after multiple market crashes. By analyzing market price fluctuations, we can achieve valuable insight regarding future trends. This research proposes a novel method for prediction using pattern analysis and classification. For the first part of the research, a trend analysis algorithm, Elliot wave theory, is used to classify price patterns for DJIA, S&P500, and NASDAQ into three categories: LONG, SHORT, and HOLD. After labeling patterns, classification learning algorithms including decision tree, naïve Bayes, and support vector machine (SVM) are used to learn from the patterns and make a prediction for the future. The algorithm is implemented during the market crashes of May 2010 and August 2015, and the obtained results show that it correctly identifies the market volatility by issuing HOLD and SHORT signals during those crashes. © 2021 IGI Global.

abstract={There was an outbreak of pneumonia in the month of December 2019 in Wuhan, China that spread with a rapid rate throughout the country and shook the world by spreading across the globe causing many deaths due. This disease is confirmed by means of molecular method as a novel coronavirus and was named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in its initial stage; however, on February 11, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) renamed this disease COVID-19, which means corona virus disease. COVID-19 has impacted nearly the entire world, affecting more than 100 countries including India. The Coronavirus Study Group consisting of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses renamed this virus, which was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This nomenclature is based on taxonomy, phylogeny, and established practice. As on March 2020, WHO has confirmed 692,575 number of cases of COVID-19 with 33,099 deaths, which are distributed across the globe: Western Pacific region with 103,775 confirmed cases with 3,649 deaths; European region with 392,757 number of confirmed cases with 23,962 deaths; South East Asia region with 4,084 confirmed cases with 158 deaths; Eastern Mediterranean region with 46,392 confirmed cases with 2,813 number of deaths; America region with 142,081 confirmed cases with 2,457 deaths; African region with 3,486 confirmed cases with 60 deaths. This paper focuses on these areas and regions and tries to find establish the relationship between numbers of deaths and number of cases with respect to the temperature. This paper takes the study of specific areas around the world and also the case study of India to study the effect of temperature on the rise of and death due to COVID-19 virus. © 2020 IGI Global.

abstract={Big data has raised challenges and opportunities for the education sector. Educational analytics encompass a variety of computational techniques to process educational big data for effective teaching, learning, research, service, and administrative decision making. Learning analytics and academic analytics have been widely discussed in the literature of education; however, knowledge analytics have not been discussed in the educational analytics field. Knowledge analytics are a relatively new subject in the knowledge management area. Knowledge analytics lie outside of the definitions of learning analytics and academic analytics, and encompass analytical activities for knowledge management among educators in teaching, research, and services. This paper discusses potential applications of knowledge analytics in educational institutions and issues related to implementation of knowledge analytics in the educational environment.

abstract={Currently, it is the age of social market due to the growth of internet technologies. The marketers require the complete information of customer perspectives on products and services comparing with others. The RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary) model is a technique to measure a comparison of information, especially in traditional market analytics. Over the past decade, social market big data (SMBD), especially feedback, has been used to understand customer satisfaction. This paper proposes a new approach to classify the products from feedbacks, called the RFC (recency, frequency, and credit) model. The model focuses on the social market information and product categorization applying the natural language processing (NLP), opinion mining (OM), and data mining (DM) techniques.

abstract={With the emergence of the internet as a popular source of information as well as a mass communication channel where peoples share their opinions regarding the quality of products/services, their pre- and post-purchase experiences, electronic word of mouth (EWOM) has become an interesting area of research to determine its role on the customer attitude and loyalties at the individual level and product sales at the market level. The impact of EWOM readability, length, and sentiment along with product ratings and price on the sales rank of cell phones has not been thoroughly investigated in the literature. To address this research gap, the authors propose three econometric models to assess the influence of EWOM measures on product sales. This modeling approach allows us to investigate the extent of influence of sentiment and readability scores on the endogenous variable namely sales rank. The utility of this incremental approach is reinforced by the high value of adjusted R^2 square achieved. Copyright © 2020, IGI Global.

abstract={The web of things (WoT) improves syntactic interoperability between internet of things (IoT) devices by leveraging web standards. However, the lack of a unified WoT data model remains a challenge for the semantic interoperability. Fortunately, semantic web technologies are taking this challenge over by offering numerous semantic vocabularies like the semantic sensor networks (SSN) ontology. Although it enables the semantic interoperability between heterogeneous devices, the manual annotation hinders the scalability of the WoT. As a result, the automation of the semantic annotation of WoT devices becomes a prior issue for researchers. This paper proposes a method to improve the semi-automatic semantic annotation of web of things (WoT) using the entity linking task and the well-known ontologies, mainly the SSN.

abstract={Insider trading is one the most common deceptive trading practice in securities markets. Data mining appears as an effective approach to tackle the problems in fraud detection with high accuracy. In this study, the authors aim to detect outlying insider transactions depending on the variables affecting insider trading profitability. 1,241,603 sales and purchases of insiders, which range from 2010 to 2017, are analyzed by using classical and robust outlier detection methods. They computed robust distance scores based on minimum volume ellipsoid, Stahel-Donoho, and fast minimum covariance determinant estimators. To investigate the outlying observations that are likely to be fraudulent, they employ event study analysis to measure abnormal returns of outlying transactions. The results are compared to the abnormal returns of non-outlying transactions. They find that outlying transactions gain higher abnormal returns than transactions that are not flagged as outliers. Business intelligence and analytics may be a useful strategy for detecting and preventing of financial fraud for companies. Copyright © 2020, IGI Global.},

abstract={The goal of comprehensive epilepsy centers (CECs) is to diagnose and treat individuals with epilepsy and other episodic disorders. To do this, epilepsy specialists rely upon electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques. EEG is a central component of CECs, providing critical information for the diagnosis and management of patients with seizure disorders. Additionally, EEG is a critical revenue generator for epilepsy programs, allowing for sustained growth and expansion programs in most institutions. This study uses a linear programming model to determine optimal allocation of EEG resources within a CEC, specifically considering volumes of inpatient routine EEG, outpatient EEG, and inpatient Video- EEG monitoring. The study demonstrates that the most significant contributor to overall revenue to the program was available EEG technologist hours. This finding suggests that CECs should prioritize programs related to increased EEG technologist training, recruitment, and retention to maintain and expand revenue and procedure volume.

abstract={Rainfall forecasting plays a significant role in water management for agriculture in a country like India where the economy depends heavily upon agriculture. In this paper, a feed forward artificial neural network (ANN) and a multiple linear regression model has been utilized for lagged time series data of monthly rainfall. The data for 23 years from 1990 to 2012 over Indian region has been used in this study. Convincing values of root mean squared error between actual monthly rainfall and that predicted by ANN has been found. It has been found that during monsoon months, rainfall of every n+3rd month can be predicted using last three months' (n, n+1, n+2) rainfall data with an excellent correlation coefficient that is more than 0.9 between actual and predicted rainfall. The probabilities of dry seasonal month, wet seasonal month for monsoon and non-monsoon months have been found. Copyright © 2020, IGI Global.},

abstract={This paper analyzes the income elasticity of household demand for communication and IT products in 23 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries during the period from 2008 to 2015. By using panel data analysis, the authors find that both communication and IT products are necessary to the households in the OECD countries as a whole. By using OLS and GLS regression for each country, they compare the change of each one's income elasticity over two periods during 1989 to 2015. The authors find that communication and IT products were considered luxury goods by the households in these countries from 1989 to 2001. However, from 2008 to 2015 such products were considered necessary, luxury, or inferior goods separately by the households in various OECD countries. The trend is that the income elasticity is decreasing, and households in some OECD countries start to take such products as necessary goods. Both panel analysis and regression results suggest that most of households take communication and IT products as necessary. Copyright © 2020, IGI Global.},

abstract={Big Data in the current context is an asset for any government body as it helps in efficient and effective governance with the help of technology so as to create and build a citizen centric approach. As digitization has become an integral part of everyday life, data collection has resulted in the accumulation of huge amounts of data that can be used in various beneficial application domains. Effective analysis and utilization of big data is a key factor for success in many business and service domains. The Government of India initiated a Big Data exercise by collecting data in various forms, namely, PAN card data, voter ID card data, AADHAR data, BPL data, etc., which was meant to pass on the benefits of a specific nature to the beneficiaries. Various schemes have been conceived and implemented by different state and central governments wherein Big Data has been generated and has helped the beneficiaries in different facets of receiving the benefits. The next step of all these smart initiatives and smart data is to logically and correctly use the data for transiting the current policies into the futuristic levels. This paper selectively reviews and analyzes the Indian policy context regarding Big Data, data analytics and the associated technology requirements in the e-governance context.

abstract={In the current, highly competitive marketplace, customer demand is a major factor in the product design process. Most firms make an effort to indicate that their products differ from the competitors’ products. The purpose of this paper is to understand customers’ expectations of and technical requirements for e-stores and to evaluate most popular e-stores in Turkey (i.e., ES1, ES2, ES3). In this study, the authors aim to understand the customer expectations and technical requirements by using quality function deployment (QFD). To prepare the house of quality (HoQ), the authors surveyed 20 experts who are customers who have elite membership (their expenses for these e-stores are more than regular customers and have elite cards) of the three e-stores and academicians. After creating the HoQ, the authors employ fuzzy linear regression to evaluate the relationships between customer expectations and technical requirements and among technical requirements themselves. Finally, the authors use zero-one goal programming (ZOGP) to select the most desirable e-store. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.

abstract={The banking sector, like other service sector, improves in accordance with the customer’s needs. Therefore, to know the needs of customers and to predict customer behaviors are very important for competition in the banking sector. Data mining uncovers relationships and hidden patterns in large data sets. Classification algorithms, one of the applications of data mining, is used very effectively in decision making. In this study, the c4.5 algorithm, a decision trees algorithm widely used in classification problems, is used in an integrated way with the ensemble machine learning methods in order to increase the efficiency of the algorithms. Data obtained via direct marketing campaigns from Portugal Banks was used to classify whether customers have term deposit accounts or not. Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines as Traditional Artificial Intelligence Methods and Bagging-C4.5 and Boosted-C.45 as ensemble-decision tree hybrid methods were used in classification. Bagging-C4.5 as ensemble-decision tree algorithm achieved more powerful classification success than other used algorithms. The ensemble-decision tree hybrid methods give better results than artificial neural networks and support vector machines as traditional artificial intelligence methods for this study.

abstract={Customer segmentation is the process of forming smaller groups of customers according to their characteristics. Now companies can develop proper marketing strategies for each group to get the desired results. This type of direct marketing is practiced by most organizations from the size of smallest start-up to the Fortune 500 leaders. Clustering is the ideal data mining technique for customer segmentation. In this article, the authors have proposed a clustering algorithm based on the self-organizing map and minimum spanning tree for customer segmentation. The authors have used several synthetic and real-life datasets to evaluate the clustering performance of their approach. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the authors’ proposed approach, they have trained few classifiers with the groups extracted from a direct marketing campaign of a Portuguese banking institution and show that the classification accuracy is better compared to the results obtained in some previous work where the full dataset has been used to train the same classifiers.

abstract={Currency counterfeiting is a serious matter of concern for government and national finance organizations. The policy makers have formed a zero tolerance policy for counterfeiting, but still the incidence of counterfeit notes is becoming an alarming situation. The counterfeited banknotes reduce the value of real money and an increase in the money supply is not just a solution, because it leads to inflation. Counterfeiting poses tangible as well as intangible impacts and affects business organizations and thereby a nation’s economy. Therefore, the research study aims to identify the factors that affects the counterfeiting in Indian banknotes. Questionnaire as a data collection instrument was used to collect data from the north-west region of Delhi. The factors were then identified through exploratory factor analysis and standardized using a confirmatory factor analysis. At last, the relative effect of each factor was measured using multiple regression analysis as a part of confirmatory factor analysis. IBM SPSS 20 and IBM AMOS is used for factor analysis.

abstract={In this article, the authors present a model for the pricing of a substitute and complementary products (four commodities) while the seller delivers the products individually, in the form of a package to the final customer, and compares the profits from the sale of each scenario. Also, a comparative study has been completed. In the package sale, two complementary products are delivered in one package, but each item is sold in separate sales. The demand function for each product is a function of the price. To illustrate the validity of the model, numerical examples have been used and a sensitivity analysis has been done on the important parameters in the problem. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.},

The model is well suited for tracking opinion dynamics over large online systems such as Twitter and Yelp where opinions need to be extracted from the user-generated text data. Theoretical conditions for the existence of consensus and the impact that stubborn agents have on opinion dynamics are also presented. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.},

abstract={This article presents the relationship between a firm's advertisement spending and sales in a duopoly when information about the competitors' advertisement spending is unavailable. The competitive interaction between the firms has been modeled as imperfect information Cournot and Stackelberg games and the conditions for subgame perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium are presented. The results suggest that when the firms are similar in size and advertisement effectiveness, both firms are better off sharing their advertising plans with each other. On the other hand, when one of the firms is a market leader, the follower may profit from the leader's advertisement spending and so is better off keeping the leader guessing. A practical approach to estimate the optimum advertisement budget based on the expected values of the competitors' historic advertising spending is presented as well. Copyright © 2018, IGI Global.},

abstract={This chapter describes how in today's competitive world, the survival of businesses is highly dependent on satisfying the customers and responding to their demands. The furniture industry is one of the markets that consists high level of competition and customers in different groups. The industry has a rapid growth by improving the economic conditions and quality of life in the world. However, the capability and competitiveness of suppliers and retailers for domestic and imported products are a big challenge. This brings the importance of the strategic analysis approach to the industry. The aim of this article is to implement strategic group maps to understand the dynamics of the furniture market in a selected case study. The used method is the first in the furniture industry and the market analysis is based on the both suppliers/retailers and customers' viewpoints. The outputs show the furniture industry can be categorized in the five groups with specific required demand and strategy in each group. Copyright © 2018, IGI Global.},

The authors call this new method the Lazy Professor Risk Task (LPRT). This article compares the LPRT’s results to popular conventional methods where monetary outcomes are involved. The results show that the new method is capable of producing consistent responses at approximately the same rate as comparable conventional methods. In addition, the method produced responses that were no noisier than conventional methods. It is hoped that future research can perfect this new method and use it to compare classroom risk taking to risk taking in other domains. Copyright © 2018, IGI Global.},

abstract={Leveraging a popular operations management simulation, we examine how team interaction, students’ previous software experience, simulations’ ease of use, team leadership, and instructors’ guidance affects students’ comprehension. Respondents completed a 27-item survey designed to assess individual comprehension. To illustrate the various affects, we use structural equation modeling to compare first-generation and continuing-generation undergraduate populations. The results indicate software’s ease of use and instructors’ guidance affects both groups, while team interaction to comprehension is present for only first-generation students. We also find that the strength of the various relationships depends on the population of students being studied. As simulations continue to grow in popularity, educators need to recognize how these pedagogical tools affect different student populations. Copyright © 2018, IGI Global.},

abstract={In this research, the authors propose DEA (data envelopment analysis) profit efficiency models for production planning which is one of important problems in the production and operations management. Different from traditional models, the constraint that the optimal output is supposed to be not less than the original one from the production possibility set is omitted in their developed no output constraint maximum profit (NOCMP) model. Besides, observing that output prices could be varied with the total market demand in the market, the researchers present the no output constraint maximum profit with varied output price (NOCMP-VOP) model. The authors apply these two DEA profit efficiency models to U.S. airline industry for illustration. The developed NOCMP and NOCMP-VOP models in this study contribute to developments of both the DEA profit efficiency model and its applications. Copyright © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={In the current literature, there are several studies, which the supplier selection is typically a Multi Criteria Group Decision Making problem. Several solutions for the above problem are proposed (from simple approaches; like, Borda, Condorcet, etc., to complex ones; like, Multiple Criteria Decision Making model combined with intuitionistic fuzzy set, etc.). To solve this problem, different method (particularly, extended TOPSIS method) are proposed in this paper. Firstly, we have used TOPSIS to find the individual preference ordering, then, we have used the extended version of this method to find the collective preference orderings. In addition, this model is capable of considering the expert weights. Finally, the proposed approach is compared with an existed approach (i.e., TOPSIS and Borda’s function).

abstract={The aim of this conceptual paper is to propose a toolkit to assist entrepreneurs to evaluate their organizational goals achievement. This toolkit is design as a clear set of systematic guideline for organizations to analyse their data to extract value that meet certain organizational goals. It allows entrepreneurs to manage their data based on accepted good practice, which their organizations can adopt to evaluate the level of their goals achievement. The implementation of the toolkit explains how data can be analysed in relation to the organizational goals. By using the toolkit, organization can trace how data is flows across the organizations, identify the relevant data and seeks to define a metrics to analyse relevant data. As a result, it improves the understanding of the relationship between organizational data and organizational goals that can lead to an effective evaluation of the goals achievement.

abstract={All textbooks and articles dealing with classical tests in the context of linear models stress the implications of a significantly large F-ratio since it indicates that the mean square for whatever effect is being evaluated contains significantly more than just error variation. In general, though, with one minor exception, all texts and articles, to the authors’ knowledge, ignore the implications of an F-ratio that is significantly smaller than one would expect due to chance alone. Why this is so difficult to explain since such an occurrence is similar to a range value falling below the lower limit on a control chart for variation or a p-value falling below the lower limit on a control chart for proportion defective. In both of those cases the small value represents an unusual and significant occurrence and, if valid, a process change that indicates an improvement. Therefore, it behooves the quality manager to determine what that change is in order to have it continue. In the case of a significantly small F-ratio some problem may be indicated that requires the designer of the experiment to identify it, and to take “corrective action.” While graphical procedures are available for helping to identify some of the possible problems that are discussed they are somewhat subjective when deciding if one is looking at an actual effect; e.g., interaction, or whether the result is merely due to random variation. A significantly small F-ratio can be used to support conclusions based on the graphical procedures by providing a level of statistical significance as well as serving as a warning flag or warning that problems may exist in the design and/or analysis.

abstract={A number of ETL procedures are used in the process of loading data to data warehouse systems. Some procedures can be executed concurrently in parallel mode, while for the others there are precedence constraints. Thus, the problem in scheduling procedures for execution is similar to the problem of scheduling of jobs in multiprocessor systems. The solution to this problem has been proposed in the optimum schedule of jobs minimizing the total execution time. When optimizing the schedule for ETL procedures, minimization of the total execution time is not the primary goal. Namely, the ETL procedures provide data required for reports aimed for business users and such reports need to be prepared until the user-defined deadlines. If the deadlines are not breached, the solution is satisfactory, regardless of the total execution time. Also, one cannot assume that all ETL processes are of the same importance – some have higher priorities than the others. That is the reason why prioritization and introduction of explicit bounds to completion time for individual ETL processes is attempted with genetic algorithm (GA). This paper encompasses implementation of the algorithm, experiments with different parameters and testing the quality of obtained solutions. Copyright © 2015, IGI Global.},

abstract={This paper studies the holistic issue of the combination of analyst projection accuracy, diversity, and distribution. It first tracks the earnings per share and sales projections of a number of equity analysts for 17 representative U.S. companies using data from 1978 to 2012. It also compares the analysts' consensus of earnings per share, sales, rating, and price target zone to identify the degree of concentration among the opinions. It finds that the magnitudes and coefficient variations of projection errors are small, and the analysts' opinions are insignificantly diversified. Analysts' projections are not significantly skewed, but pessimistic opinions dominate. The results suggest that the projections issued by equity analysts are generally precise, and following their opinions is technically feasible. Analysts' mistakes are more due to inappropriate investment timing and less due to their abilities to pick firms with robust future performance. Copyright © 2015, IGI Global.},

abstract={The task of a recommender system evaluation has often been addressed in the literature, however there exists no consensus regarding the best metrics to assess its performance. This research deals with collaborative filtering recommendation systems, and proposes a new approach for evaluating the quality of neighbor selection. It theorizes that good recommendations emerge from good selection of neighbors. Hence, measuring the quality of the neighborhood may be used to predict the recommendation success. Since user neighborhoods in recommender systems are often sparse and differ in their rating range, this paper designs a novel measure to asses a neighborhood quality. First it builds the realization based entropy (RBE), which presents the classical entropy measure from a different angle. Next it modifies the RBE and propose the realization based distance entropy (RBDE), which considers also continuous data. Using the RBDE, it finally develops the consent entropy, which takes into account the absence of rating data. The paper compares the proposed approach with common approaches from the literature, using several recommendation evaluation metrics. It presents offline experiments using the Netflix database. The experimental results confirm that consent entropy performs better than commonly used metrics, particularly with high sparsity neighborhoods.

abstract={Estimating the benefits of network security systems is important for security decisions since considerable resources are spent on them and organizations need to know the returns on their investments. The objective of the model presented here is to improve management decisions. Better decisions imply greater security for the budget. This model has a number of novel features such as a probabilistic sub-model for the detection and response process, a new attack/damage matrix based on damage-type and cyber-attacks by category, and extensive sensitivity analyses. The results suggest a number of insights into the factors affecting the benefits from sensors such as the effects of non-linear relationships between the rate of attacks and the damages caused. The key role of the value of sensitive information is identified. The model helps identify the conditions under which a new security system provides enough benefits to justify its purchase.

abstract={Integrated quality and reliability models should be developed to improve system performance simultaneously, because quality and reliability are inherently related in a sense that quality inspection and monitoring decisions impact anticipated reliability and failure time distributions. Especially for degrading systems, important decisions including burn-in, quality inspection and preventive maintenance should be incorporated into an integratedmodelconsidering manufacturing variability andassociated failure mechanisms. For various linear and non-linear degradation models, this paper develops conditional reliability functions and truncated failure time distributions considering the impacts of burn-in and quality inspection at manufacturing phase. It shows that burn-in and quality inspection policies have significant impacts on reliability performance of products in field operation. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the results. The developed reliability models can be readily used for optimizing burn-in, quality inspection and maintenance decisions simultaneously. © 2014,IGI Global.},
