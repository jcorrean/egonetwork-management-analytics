abstract={Analytics have been employed by companies for several decades, but now many firms are interested in building their capabilities for artificial intelligence (AI). Many AI systems, however, are based on statistics and other forms of analytics. Companies can get a “running start” on AI by building upon their analytical competencies. The focus of this article is how to transition from analytics to AI. Three eras of analytical focus are detailed, with AI portrayed as a fourth era. The types of AI methods that are and are not based on analytics are described. AI applications that build on analytical strengths are discussed. Approaches to assessing analytical capabilities that relate to AI, and the development of an organizational plan and strategy for AI, are also described in brief. © Operational Research Society 2018.},

abstract={There are plenty of definitions proposed for business analytics–some of them focus on the scope/coverage/problem, some on the nature of the data, and some concentrate on the enabling methods and methodologies. The common denominator of all of these definitions is that business analytics is the encapsulation of all mechanisms that help convert data into actionable insight for better and faster decision-making. Although the name is new, its purpose has been around for several decades, characterised under different labels. Largely driven by the need in the business world, business analytics has become one of the most active research areas in academics and in industry/practice. The Journal of Business Analytics is created to establish a dedicated home for analytics researchers to publish their research outcomes. Covering all facets of business analytics (descriptive/diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive), the journal is destined to become the pinnacle for rigorous and relevant analytics research manuscripts. Herein we provide an overview of research challenges and opportunities for business analytics to lay the groundwork for this new journal. © 2018 Operational Research Society.},

abstract={Open-ended responses are widely used in market research studies. Processing of such responses requires labour-intensive human coding. This paper focuses on unsupervised topic models and tests their ability to automate the analysis of open-ended responses. Since state-of-the-art topic models struggle with the shortness of open-ended responses, the paper considers three novel short text topic models: Latent Feature Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Biterm Topic Model and Word Network Topic Model. The models are fitted and evaluated on a set of real-world open-ended responses provided by a market research company. Multiple components such as topic coherence and document classification are quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated to appraise whether topic models can replace human coding. The results suggest that topic models are a viable alternative for open-ended response coding. However, their usefulness is limited when a correct one-to-one mapping of responses and topics or the exact topic distribution is needed. © 2019 The Author(s).

abstract={Searches of the Web using Google, and database searches of the academic and practitioner literature, return a large number of differing and varied definitions of the concept of business analytics. This article reviews the growing literature on Business Analytics (BA) using traditional and qualitative research tools. Our searches included using Google Search to identify examples of business analytics applications, and a focused keyword search of the available practitioner and academic literatures. Text analytics techniques identified frequently used terms in prior definitions of business analytics. Our empirical, inductive approach provides a basis for proposing and explaining a formal sentence definition for Business Analytics. The analysis provides a starting point for operationalising a measure for the business analytics construct. Additionally, understanding business analytics can help managers assess skill deficiencies and evaluate claims about relevance of tools and techniques. Finally, carefully defining the Business Analytics concept should provide stimulus for new research ideas. © 2018 Operational Research Society.},

abstract={Massive social media data present businesses with an immense opportunity to extract useful insights. However, social media messages typically consist of both facts and opinions, posing a challenge to analytics applications that focus more on either facts and opinions. Distinguishing facts and opinionss may significantly improve subsequent analytics tasks. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based algorithm that automatically separates facts from opinions in Twitter messages. The algorithm outperformed multiple popular baselines in an experiment we conducted. We further applied the proposed algorithm to track customer complaints and found that it indeed benefits subsequent analytics applications. © 2018 Operational Research Society.},

abstract={Ride-sharing services have been popularly used for both short-distance and long-distance trips. The recent introduction and growth of bike-sharing services can help solve the last mile problem and provide a good mobility option, especially for short-distance travellers. We examine the extent to which bike-sharing platforms solve the last mile problem and affect short-distance travels by studying their impacts on ride-sharing orders. To do so, we exploit a natural experiment setting in which bike-sharing platforms were newly launched in Chengdu, China. We combine detailed granular one-month order data collected from DiDi with Chengdu’s geographic information data from Gaode Map, a Chinese leading map provider. We find that the introduction of bike-sharing platforms significantly reduces short-distance ride-sharing orders. We additionally examine the heterogeneity in substitution effects across different pickup and drop-off locations and find that location attributes significantly affect bike-sharing’s substitution effects on ride-sharing platforms. © 2018 Operational Research Society.},

abstract={Business Analytics makes the assumption that given a sufficient set of analytics capabilities exist within an organisation, the existence of these capabilities will result in the generation of organisational value and/or competitive advantage. Taken further, do enhanced capability levels lead to enhanced impact for organisations? Capability in this study is grounded in the four pillars of Governance, Culture, Technology and People from the Cosic, Shanks and Maynard capability framework. We set out to undertake the first empirical investigation to measure if there is a positive relationship between Business Analytics capability levels as defined by Cosic, Shanks and Maynard, and the generation of value and competitive advantage for organisations, and do enhanced capability levels lead to enhanced impact. Data gathered from a survey of 64 senior analytics professionals from 17 sectors provides evidence to support that a strong and statistically significant correlation exists between higher capability levels and the ability to generate enhanced organisational value and competitive advantage. Additionally, a revised definition of Business Analytics is proposed, given that Business Analytics should give rise to organisational value and/or competitive advantage and that for this to occur the necessary capabilities must be in place. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

abstract={Although business analytics has received its fair share of attention, extant research has paid insufficient attention to establishing and communicating a general understanding of the relationship between analytics and performance. In order to reduce the identified knowledge gap, this study proposes a comprehensive, theoretical framework to explain the key types of business analytics, their relationships, and how business analytics use impacts operational and financial performance. This study proposes a combination of critical systems, “holistic thinking/big picture/decision-making,” approaches to moderate key relationships to impact performance. Additionally, this study presents a case illustration of a real-world contract manufacturer, employing the proposed framework, to demonstrate the innovative use of integrated business analytics to turnaround an organization, and position it to survive, thrive, innovate, and grow. Findings indicate that firms, “overwhelmed by” and “struggling to use” data to improve business results, have a viable cost-effective framework to advance business analytics capability, in their organizations. © Operational Research Society 2018.},

abstract={Like many other disciplines, the information systems (IS) community has embraced big data analytics and data science. However, in the rush to exploit the popularity of this latest trend, the areas of big data analytics and data science that are most relevant to the IS field are not made clear. While many consider data analytics as an evolution of decision support systems (DSS), that is, as a technology that needs to be managed or enhanced, this essay traces the complex origins and philosophy of analytics instead back to Luhn’s text analytics in the late 1950s, Naur’s Computing as a Human Activity and his datalogy, Tukey’s Future of Data Analysis of the 1960s, and Codd’s relational database schema in the 1970s, well before big data analytics and data science became industry buzzwords. Many of what is now considered mainstream thinking in big data analytics and data science can be traced back to these visionaries. This essay examines the implications of the complex origins of data analytics and data science for the IS field, specifically on how those different discourses impact future research and practice. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

abstract={We propose two methods for time-series clustering that capture temporal information (trend, seasonality, autocorrelation) and domain-relevant cross-sectional attributes. The methods are based on model-based partitioning (MOB) trees and can be used as automated yet transparent tools for clustering large collections of time series. We address the challenge of using common time-series models in MOB by instead utilising least squares regression. We propose two methods. The single-step method clusters series using trend, seasonality, lags and domain-relevant cross-sectional attributes. The two-step method first clusters by trend, seasonality and cross-sectional attributes, and then clusters the residuals by autocorrelation and domain-relevant attributes. Both methods produce clusters interpretable by domain experts. We illustrate our approach by considering one-step-ahead forecasting and compare to autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models for forecasting many Wikipedia pageviews time series. The tree-based approach produces forecasts on par with ARIMA, yet is significantly faster and more efficient, thereby suitable for large collections of time-series. The simple parametric forecasting models allow for interpretable time-series clusters. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

abstract={Forward-looking statements (FLSs) have informational value in applications such as predicting stock prices. Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) sections in initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses contain FLSs that provide prospective information about the company’s future growth and performance. This study focuses on evaluating the relationship between features extracted from FLSs and IPO valuation. To that end, we propose an analytical pipeline for identifying FLSs using machine learning techniques. The FLS classifier is built on the best performing deep learning architecture that outperforms extant methods reported in related studies. In order to demonstrate the value of identified FLSs, we conduct predictive analysis of pre-IPO price revisions and post-IPO first-day returns. We engineer a variety of linguistics features from FLSs including topics, sentiments, readability, semantic similarity, and general text features. The study finds that FLS features are more predictive for pre-IPO as compared to post-IPO valuation prediction. The analytical pipeline contributes to the text classification knowledge base while the findings from the predictive analysis shed light on understanding the underpricing phenomenon occurring in the IPO process. © 2018 Operational Research Society.},

abstract={The ability to generate business-relevant information from data and to exploit it to improve business processes, decision-making, products, and services (business analytics) is a key success factor for businesses today. Answering the call for further research on success-relevant practices and instruments for managing business analytics, we report on the results of a three-year action design research (ADR) project at a global car manufacturer. Drawing on the socio-technical systems theory, we identify seven meta-requirements and specify four principles for the design of an instrument to manage Analytics-as-a-Service (AaaS) portfolios. Our results reinforce the importance of coordinating different socio-technical components in business analytics initiatives and demonstrate how concrete management instruments, such as a proposed portfolio management tool, contribute to socio-technical alignment. For practitioners, the documented design components provide guidance on how to design and implement similar instruments that support the systematic management of AaaS portfolios. © Operational Research Society 2020.},

abstract={Besides confirming the existence of home advantage (HA) in professional sports competition, this work intends to breakdown HA into sub-components and trace the specific sources of HA. Using scoring performance data from ESPN FC, we fit a Bayesian multilevel-nested model to the parameters in our proposed hierarchical model of HA, allowing information obtained from the season level to inform the inferences about scoring capabilities at the upper team, league, and sport levels. Our analysis reveals that much of HA is attributed to the nature of the sport of interest as well as teams playing the sport. The results seem to endorse the view that home advantage is mainly characteristic of the sport and participating teams, while league grouping can be safely ignored as a credible contributing source. Finally, we discuss the implications of our proposed two-source model of HA for future research at the inter-sport level. © Operational Research Society 2020.},

abstract={Contrary to the popular belief cited in the literature, the proposed data analytics technique shows that multiple linear regression (MLR) can achieve as high a predictive power as some of the black box models when the necessary interventions are implemented pertaining to the regression diagnostic. Such an MLR model can be utilised to design an optimal concrete mix, as it provides the explicit and accurate relationships between the HPC components and the expected compressive strength. Moreover, the proposed study offers a decision support tool incorporating the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model to bridge the gap between black-box models and practitioners. The tool can be used to make faster, more data-driven, and accurate managerial decisions without having any expertise in the required fields, which would reduce a substantial amount of time, cost, and effort spent on measurement procedures of the compressive strength of HPC. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

abstract={In this paper, we explore how sensitive the timing of switches between electricity contracts is to current and past prices. We present a model for time series of individual binary decisions which depends on the history of past and present prices. The model is based on the Bayesian learning procedure which is at the core of sequential decision-making. Given a-priori distributions of the information conditional on the state of the world, we show that the model captures dependence on past prices in a straightforward fashion. We estimate by maximum likelihood the parameters of the model on a sample of Swedish households who decide over time between competing electricity price contracts. The estimated parameters suggest that households do respond to prices by switching between contracts and that the response to price can be sizeable for alternative price processes. Importantly, the model structure implies that in general, the response to a price change will not be immediate but delayed. © 2019 © The Author(s).

abstract={It is said that knowledge is power, yet often, decision makers ignore information that ought to be considered. The phenomenon known as Semmelweis reflex occurs when new knowledge is rejected because it contradicts established norms. The goal of evidence-based management (EBMgt) is to help overcome Semmelweis reflex by integrating evaluated external evidence with stakeholder preference, practitioner experiences, and context. This evaluated external evidence is the product of scientific research. In this paper, we demonstrate an EBMgt business analytics model that uses computer simulation to provide scientific evidence to help decision makers evaluate equipment replacement problems, specifically the parallel machine replacement problem. The business analytics application is demonstrated in the form of a fleet management problem for a state transportation agency. The resulting analysis uses real-world data allowing decision makers to unfreeze their current system, move to a new state, and re-freeze a new system. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

abstract={Advances in IT offer the possibility to develop ever more complex predictive and prescriptive systems based on analytics. Organizations are beginning to rely on the outputs from these systems without inspecting them, especially if they are embedded in the organization’s operational systems. This reliance could be misplaced unethical or even illegal if the systems contain bias. Data, algorithms and machine learning methods are all potentially subject to bias. In this article we explain the ways in which bias might arise in analytics systems, present some examples, and give some suggestions as to how to prevent or reduce it. We use a framework inspired by the work of Hammond, Keeney and Raiffa on psychological traps in human decision-making. Each of these traps “translates” into a potential type of bias for an analytics-based system. Fortunately, this means that remedies to reduce bias in human decision-making also translate into potential remedies for algorithmic systems. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

abstract={Business process management distinguishes the actual “as-is” and a prescribed “to-be” state of a process. In practice, many different causes trigger a process’s drifting away from its to-be state. For instance, employees may “workaround” the proposed systems to increase their effectiveness or efficiency in day-to-day work. So far, ethnography or critical incident techniques are used to identify how and why workarounds emerge. We design a deep-learning-based method that helps detect different workaround types in event logs. Our method tracks indications of potential workarounds in the early stages of their emergence among deviating behaviour. Our evaluation based on four real-life event logs reveals that our method performs well and works best for business processes with fewer variations and a higher number of different activities. The proposed method is one of the first information technology artefacts to bridge the boundaries between the complementing research disciplines of organisational routines and business processes management. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={The rise of big data has led to many new opportunities for organisations to create value from data. However, an increasing dependence on data also poses many challenges for organisations. To overcome these challenges, organisations have to establish data analytics governance. Leading IT and information governance literature shows that governance can be implemented through mechanisms. The data analytics literature is not very abundant in describing specific governance mechanisms. Hence, there is a need to identify and describe specific data analytics governance mechanisms. To this end, a preliminary framework based on literature  was developed and validated using a multiple case study design. This resulted in an extended descriptive framework that can aide managers in implementing data analytics governance. Furthermore, we draw on viable system model (VSM) theory to make a theoretical contribution by discussing how data analytics governance can contnue to fulfil its purpose of creating (business) value from data. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={Supervised machine learning methods for image analysis require large amounts of labelled training data to solve computer vision problems. The recent rise of deep learning algorithms for recognising image content has led to the emergence of many ad-hoc labelling tools. With this survey, we capture and systematise the commonalities as well as the distinctions between existing image labelling software. We perform a structured literature review to compile the underlying concepts and features of image labelling software such as annotation expressiveness and degree of automation. We structure the manual labelling task by its organisation of work, user interface design options, and user support techniques to derive a systematisation schema for this survey. Applying it to available software and the body of literature, enabled us to uncover several application archetypes and key domains such as image retrieval or instance identification in healthcare or television. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={Draft decisions by National Basketball Association (NBA) teams are notoriously poor. Analytics can help but are often dismissed for being too overfit, complex, risky, and incomplete. To address these concerns, we train separate leave-one-out random forests machine learning models for each collegiate NBA prospect from 2006 through 2019 with a conservative utility function on a novel comprehensive dataset including the raw text of scouting reports, combine measurements, on-court stats, mock draft placements, and more. Despite being unable to draft high school or international players, the resulting model outperforms the actual decisions of all but one NBA team, with an average gain of $100 million. Target shuffling shows that the model does not overfit and feature shuffling shows that handedness and ESPN mock draft rating, but not other mock drafts, are most important. NBA teams may be missing value by not following a disciplined, model-driven, prescriptive analytics approach to decision making. © 2021 Operational Research Society 2021.},

abstract={This study aims to develop a decision support tool for identifying the point velocity profiles in rivers. The tool enables managers to make timely and accurate decisions, thereby eliminating a substantial amount of time, cost, and effort spent on measurement procedures. In the proposed study, three machine learning classification algorithms, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Classification & Regression Trees (C&RT) and Tree Augmented Naïve Bayes (TAN) along with Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR), are employed to classify the point velocities in rivers. The results showed that ANN has outperformed the other classification algorithms in predicting the outcome that was converted into 10 ordinal classes, by achieving the accuracy level of 0.46. Accordingly, a decision support tool incorporating ANN has been developed. Such a tool can be utilized by end-users (managers/practitioners) without any expertise in the machine learning field. This tool also helps in achieving success for financial investors and other relevant stakeholders. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

abstract={The main objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the COVID-19 and the weather factors of the most populated and industrialised countries in Europe and propose the best mathematical model to forecast the daily number of COVID-19 cases. To find the relationship between the COVID-19 and the weather factors of absolute humidity and temperature in Spain, France, Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom, we conducted a Poisson analysis. We also used the General Linear Neural Network (GRNN) model to forecast the trend and number of daily COVID-19 cases in these European countries. The results reveal a statistically significant negative relationship between the number of COVID-19 infections and weather factors of temperature & absolute humidity. Furthermore, the results show a stronger negative relationship between COVID-19 and absolute humidity than temperature. In our proposed GRNN method, we find better compatibility for the COVID-19 cases in Italy relative to the other European countries in this study. © Operational Research Society 2020.},

abstract={A company’s rank vis-à-vis that of its competitors is an important metric in understanding its position in the market. For a company, being ranked below its competitors indicates that customers are dissatisfied with its products, signalling the need for a review of its strategies. Existing state-of-the-art methods for ascertaining a company’s rank do not utilise the valuable data available on social media or most smart technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence. This study develops a new method to estimate a company’s rank using company-deployed intelligent software agents and social IoT(SIoT) objects. The company objects collect real-time feedback about one or more of the company products from social networks for storage and analysis. These company objects are equipped with questionnaires with important metrics such as the Customer Happiness Index, opinion on features of competitive products, expectations in upcoming models of the product. Then neutrosophic numbers have been used to determine truthiness, falsity and indeterminacy of each opinion and based on such opinions, rank of a company is determined. © Operational Research Society 2020.},

abstract={There is a surge in the development of decision-oriented analysis tools intended to extract actionable information from text. These tools integrate various text-mining methods that were performance tested in a manner that was often biased toward the new system. Those tests primarily utilised descriptive measurement criteria and test datasets that are inconsistent with most business corpora. We propose and test a user-oriented judgment approach that allows testing under controlled customer-oriented corpora and generates effect size measures.  To illustrate the approach, customer relations data was analysed by latent semantic analysis and latent Dirichlet analysis with results evaluated by prospective business analysts. Reporting includes comparisons of results with published literature. While the research centres on the context-region text-mining systems, literature comparisons include word-embedding methods. The analysis concludes that none of the systems reviewed possess a repeatable statistical advantage over the others. Instead, distribution attributes, algorithm configuration, and the evaluation task drive results. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

abstract={This study explores ways an organisation can save time; review all proposed innovative, internal ideas; and, identify relevant start-up companies able to bring these ideas to fruition within a knowledge management framework. It uses text-mining techniques, including Python for data extraction and manipulation and topic modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Jaccard similarity indexes as a basis for evaluation of potentially valuable project ideas. Results show that internal organisational project ideas can be automatically matched with external data regarding potential implementation partners using big data knowledge management approaches. This ensures internal ideas are not overlooked or lost, but rather considered further so potentially profitable and viable opportunities are not missed. Increased use of big data to predict innovation and add value opens new channels to utilise text analysis in organisations and ensure internal innovation through a sustainable knowledge management approach. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

abstract={Organisations utilise social media technologies for various customer engagement and external-facing activities in recent years. This research examines the extent to which the business strategies and social media strategies of organisations are aligned. Using a sample of 33 organisations competing in the information technology industry, the business strategies were operationalised using data extracted from the annual 10-K reports while the social media strategies were identified from the Twitter feeds. Topic modelling with latent semantic analysis revealed six different orientations in the business and social media strategies of organisations, which were used to evaluate alignment. This study also identified clusters of organisations with varying levels of alignment. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

abstract={The study analyses the predictors of a win for four international cricket teams in the one-day international cricket format. A binary logistic regression is used to determine the relationship between the independent variables, i.e., fours and sixes scored, bowling economy, extras conceded, fielding dismissals, the number of debutants from each side, umpire’s nationality, pitch condition, and season of play vis-à-vis odds of a win. The study found that the number of fielding dismissals and bowler economy significantly influence the odds of winning for all four teams. Further, the nationality of the umpire did not affect any team, while other variables influenced the fortunes of different teams differently. Proposed models in the paper can be used by team management and coaches in devising match strategy and player selection for higher win outcomes based on a combination of historical trend data for specific variables and actual data for the others. © Operational Research Society 2022.},

abstract={This article presents in-game win probability models for Canadian football. Play-by-play and wagering data for games from the Canadian Football League for the 2015 to 2019 seasons is used to create logistic regression and gradient boosting models. Models with and without the effect of pregame spread and total (over/under) data are presented and discussed. The resulting win probability models are well-calibrated and can be used to support in-game decision-making, review coaching decisions, estimate the magnitude of team “comebacks”, and potentially identify in-game wagering opportunities. An R Shiny application is provided to allow for estimation of in-game win probability for user-provided game state inputs. Opportunities for future work are identified and described. © Operational Research Society 2021.},

abstract={Regression analysis is a widely used modelling tool in business decision making. However, proper application of this methodology requires that certain assumptions, associated with the model, be satisfied. The assumption we focus on is the normality of the response variable, which is directly related to the assumption of normality of the error component. In a variety of fields in business, such as finance, marketing, information systems, operations, and healthcare, the selected dependent variable does not inherently have a normal distribution. In the regression context, where the model parameters and independent variables are assumed to be constant, the distribution of the random error component thus influences the distribution of the dependent variable. Here, we study the impact of symmetric and asymmetric error distributions on the performance of the estimated model parameters. To create robust estimates, through a process of trimming the response variable, we study the effectiveness of the trimmed estimators with respect to the ordinary least squares estimator (OLS) via a simulation procedure. Accordingly, to minimise the ratio of the mean squared error of the trimmed estimator to that of the OLS, a recommendation is developed for the optimal trimming proportion. © Operational Research Society 2021.},

abstract={This paper offers a framework for analysis to benefit buying firms as they evaluate current and prospective suppliers, and to assist supplying organisations in becoming more competitive. It explores the notion of performance improvement frontiers for suppliers, in the context of developing suppliers rather than rationalising or pruning them. Dual-efficiency (strengths and weaknesses) frontiers are constructed using inverted efficiency techniques. Unilateral and bilateral approaches to the construction of these frontiers are examined. It is found that certain information content of bilaterally determined DEA assurance ranges can serve as a compromise between the buyer’s ideal performance priorities and a supplier’s capability-based priorities. For this reason, it represents a reasonable and jointly determined set of performance expectations for buyers to recommend to the supplier set. For the suppliers themselves, the bilateral ranges contribute a prioritised behavioural focus to develop or improve their capabilities on specific performance attributes. © Operational Research Society 2021.},

abstract={Medical schools store large sets of patient data. The data is important for the analysis of trends and patterns in healthcare practice. However, obtaining access to the data can be problematic due to the data protection mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the current practices from the lens of both the data requester and the data provider. Results reveal discrepancies between how the provider organises the data governance process, how the process is presented to the data requester, and the data requester’s perception of satisfactory user experience. This study provides a simple one interview mental model method approach for data governance services to reveal potential problems in the process. This is a quick and effective method for data providers to help uncover the challenges and to provide foundations for future fully automated (human out of the loop) systems for data accessibility in healthcare organisations. © Operational Research Society 2021.},

abstract={The biggest concern about diabetes-related complications is that they are unrecognised in the early stages but can be immutable and devastating with time. Identifying the population at high risk of developing such complications can help intervene in preventative care at an early stage. This study aims to present a data-driven approach to predict the patients at higher risk for diabetes-related complications using real-world data. We used comorbid diagnostic features from the electronic health records called “Cerner Health Facts EMR Data” to build machine learning-based prediction models for three diabetes-related long-term complications: (a) eye diseases, (b) kidney diseases, and (c) neuropathy. Our developed pipeline was able to generate highly accurate models for predictions. We deduced from the F1-scores that applying the class balancing techniques improved the overall performance of the models, and SVM with oversampling technique was the most consistent classifier for all three cohorts. © Operational Research Society 2021.},

abstract={In this work, a method to characterise the daily sales revenue for an online store is presented. Daily sales revenue is a time series. The developed characterisation identifies the major sources of variation in the time series. Such a characterisation can be used for purposes such as developing structural forecasting models and extracting insights that can be leveraged for business and operations planning. In this work, this characterisation is developed using a technique called Singular Spectrum Analysis. Achieving good results with Singular Spectrum Analysis requires the judicious selection of an algorithm parameter called the window length. A framework to select this parameter is provided. Literature survey revealed that applications of Singular Spectrum Analysis to business data are limited. To the best of found knowledge from the literature survey, Singular Spectrum Analysis has not been applied to retail revenue stream analysis. © Operational Research Society 2021.},

abstract={Process mining provides analytical tools and methods which can distil insights about process behaviour from big process-related data. Yet challenges relating to the impact of poor quality data on event logs, the input to process mining analyses, remain. Despite researchers raising concerns about event log data quality, event log preparation is, in practice, generally handled mechanistically, focusing on fixing symptoms rather than on uncovering the root causes of event log data quality issues. To address this, we introduce the Odigos (Greek for “guide”) framework. Based on semiotics and Peircean abductive reasoning, the Odigos framework facilitates an informed way of dealing with data quality issues in event logs. Odigos supports both prognostic (foreshadowing potential quality issues) and diagnostic (identifying root causes of discovered quality issues) approaches. We examine in depth how the framework supports a detailed root-cause analysis of a well-known collection of event log imperfection patterns. © Operational Research Society 2021.},

abstract={Today, a myriad of data is generated via connected devices and digital applications. In order to benefit from these data, companies have to develop their capabilities related to big data and analytics (BDA). A critical factor that is often cited concerning the “soft” aspects of BDA is data ownership, i.e., clarifying the fundamental rights and responsibilities for data. IS research has investigated data ownership for operational systems and data warehouses, where the purpose of data processing is known. In the BDA context, defining accountabilities for data is more challenging because data are stored in data lakes and used for previously unknown purposes. Based on four case studies, we identify ownership principles and three distinct types: data, data platform, and data product ownership. Our research answers fundamental questions about how data management changes with BDA and lays the foundation for future research on data and analytics governance. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={Machine learning in decision support systems already outperforms pre-existing statistical methods. However, their predictions face challenges as calculations are often complex and not all model predictions are traceable. In fact, many well-performing models are black boxes to the user who– consequently– cannot interpret and understand the rationale behind a model’s prediction. Explainable artificial intelligence has emerged as a field of study to counteract this. However, current research often neglects the human factor. Against this backdrop, we derived and examined factors that influence the goodness of a model’s explainability in a social evaluation of end users. We implemented six common ML algorithms for four different benchmark datasets in a two-factor factorial design and asked potential end users to rate different factors in a survey. Our results show that the perceived goodness of explainability is moderated by the problem type and strongly correlates with trustworthiness as the most important factor. © Operational Research Society 2021.},

abstract={While sentiment dictionaries are easy to apply and provide reproducible results, they often exhibit inferior classification performance compared to machine learning approaches trained for specific application domains. Nevertheless, both approaches typically require manual data analysis. This paper develops a domain-specific dictionary using regularised linear models drawing from textual reports of financial analysts. The first evaluation step demonstrates that the developed financial analyst dictionary can explain cumulative abnormal stock returns related to earnings events more accurately compared to other finance-related dictionaries and sentiment classifiers. In a second step, the approaches are compared using manually annotated sentiment. The financial analyst dictionary is more accurate than other dictionary-based approaches, although it cannot compete with a pre-trained deep learning sentiment classifier. While we show that the proposed approach is suited for texts of financial analysts, it can be applied to other use cases. The approach realises context specificity while reducing extensive manual data analysis. © Operational Research Society 2021.},

abstract={Recommender system is a data sifting tool that can recommend items that can be of interest to the user. Collaborative filtering (CF) makes recommendations based on the ratings the users give to items. But noisy or inaccurate ratings reduce the quality of the recommendations. In spite of extensive studies carried on CF-based recommenders, a robust recommender to handle outlier in dataset is a challenging problem. In this study, a Factor wise Matrix Factorisation model (FWMF) is proposed for the prediction of item rating in recommender systems. To further strengthen the proposed FWMF model, a meta learning model that combines density-based outlier detection and bagging outlier detection is proposed to detect outliers. The outliers predicted are eliminated, and a comparative analysis is carried with FWMF to find the effect of outliers in making recommendations. The experiments were analysed with various error metrics conducted on benchmark dataset show that the proposed outlier extent recommendation model outperforms the conventional CF-based systems. © Operational Research Society 2021.},

abstract={In the era of knowledge-based economy, the firm’s ability to derive actionable insights from big data can be a game changer. Such ability can be developed and nurtured by utilising BA which is designed to help business executives and policy makers make well-thought and informed decisions. To have a clear picture of what will lead to the serious consideration of BA as a business intelligence tool, this paper identifies contextual variables that include privacy, security, risk concerns, information technology (IT) capability and perceived value that may significantly influence the firm’s intention to use BA. This paper conducted confirmatory factor analyses and used the structural equation model to determine what either motivate or inhibit the BA adoption Through a series of hypothesis testing, we discovered that higher security and risk concerns along with a lack of IT capability became important deterrents to BA adoption. Also, we found that firms which recognised the value of BA were more inclined to adopt BA than the others. This paper is one of the first attempts to develop practical guidelines for the potential adopters of BA based on the empirical study of BA practices among the Korean firms. © Operational Research Society 2021.},

abstract={Grown out of the quest for artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) is today’s most active field across disciplines with a sharp increase in applications ranging from criminology to fraud detection and to biometrics. ML and statistics both emphasise model estimation/training and thus share the inescapable Type 1 and 2 errors. Extending the concept of statistical errors into the domain of ML, we devise a ground-breaking pH scale-like ratio and intend it as a litmus test indicator of ML model bias completely masked by the popular performance criterion of accuracy. Using publicly available phishing dataset, we conduct experiments on a series of classification models and consequently unravel the significant cost implications of models with varying levels of bias. Based on these results, we recommend practitioners exercise human judgement and match their own risk tolerance profile with the bias ratio associated with each ML model in order to guard against potential unintended adverse effects. © Operational Research Society 2021.},

abstract={This study presents an analytic inference methodology using probabilistic modeling that provides faster decision-making and a better understanding of complex relations. Two educational psychology models (i.e., the MUSIC Model of Motivation and the domain identification model) were coupled with a data-driven Probabilistic Graphical Model to provide a top-down and bottom-up combination for reasoning. Using survey data from middle school students, Bayesian Network models captured the probabilistic interactions between students’ perceptions of their science class, their identification with science, and their science career goals. Complex/non-linear relationships among these variables revealed that students’ perceptions of their science class (i.e., eMpowerment, Usefulness, Success, Interest, and Caring) were significant predictors of their science-related career goals. These findings provide validity evidence for using the MUSIC and domain identification models and provide educators and school administrators with a web-based simulator to estimate the effect of students’ science class perceptions on their science identification and career goals. © Operational Research Society 2021.},

abstract={The power of information and information exchange defines the current Internet and Online Social Networks (OSNs). With such power and influence, individuals and entities expose those networks to different types of false information. This paper proposes several classification models based on Quora insincere questions; a dataset released by Kaggle. We evaluated several models including word embeddings based on meta and word-level features. Best results were achieved using the BERT transformer with an overall accuracy of more than 95% on several individual classifiers. Overall, results indicated that the meta-textual features are important predictors for whether a question is sincere or not. In one implication, we noticed that users are putting more cognitive efforts into writing more readable sincere questions compared to insincere questions. Moreover, a dictionary is assembled from several explicit dictionaries and significant words selected from Quora questions. The dictionary showed a good performance in predicting insincere questions. © Operational Research Society 2021.},

abstract={The right to privacy has been discussed by scholars in multiple disciplines, yet privacy issues are increasing due to technological advances and lower costs for organisations to adopt smart surveillance. Given the potential for misuse, it seems prudent for stakeholders to critically evaluate Surveillance Analytics (SA) innovations. To assist in balancing the issues arising from SA adoption and the implications for privacy, we review key terms and ethical frameworks. Further, we prescribe a two-by-two Surveillance, Privacy, and Ethical Decision (SPED) Process Guide. SPED recommends the use of one or more of three ethical frameworks, Consequence, Duty, and Virtue. The vertical axis in the SPED matrix is the sophistication of an organisation’s SA and the horizontal axis is an assessment of the current privacy level and the rights afforded to the target(s) of surveillance. The proposed decision process guide can assist senior managers and technologists in making decisions about adopting SA. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={Overprescribing of opioids after surgical procedures can increase the risk of addiction in patients, and under prescribing can lead to poor quality of care. In this study, we propose a machine learning-based predictive framework to identify the varying effects of factors that are related to the opioid prescription amount after orthopaedic surgery. To predict the prescription classes, we train multiple classifiers combined with random and SMOTE over-sampling and weight-balancing techniques to cope with the imbalance state of the dataset. Our results show that the gradient boosting machines (XGB) with SMOTE achieve the highest classification accuracy. Our proposed analytical framework can be employed to assist and therefore, enable the surgeons to determine the timely changing effects of these variables. © Operational Research Society 2021.},

abstract={Contract renewal is critical to maintaining a company’s recurring revenue source. Therefore, there is a significant emphasis on setting up an efficient process for renewal. In this study, a machine learning technique was followed to improve contract renewal rates. In addition to this, key factors affecting renewal rates were also studied in detail. The solution presented in this study used an unsupervised machine learning technique to segment high-risk resellers with relatively lower probability of renewal, which was further actioned upon by a proactive contact strategy soliciting a contract renewal. This solution was tested and monitored for a period of three quarters. It resulted in an incremental improvement in the renewal rate for the company. As part of the implementation, a user interface application was also developed, which enabled the sales specialist to list and contact high-risk (or underperformer) resellers quarter-on-quarter. © Operational Research Society 2020.},

abstract={This study examines the relationship between cybersecurity threats faced and cybersecurity response planned by organisations. Classifying cybersecurity threats into four types–physical threats, personnel threats, communication and data threats, and operational threats–this study examines organisational responses to such threats. Using textual data on cybersecurity threats and response gathered from the 10-K reports published by 87 organisations, topic modelling was conducted to assess the threats and response. A cross-sectional time-series regression model fitted on the topic weights showed that cybersecurity response was influenced by cybersecurity threats, beyond the time-invariant control and period variables. Specifically, physical threats and operational threats influenced the technical response; physical threats, communication and data threats, and operational threats influenced the non-technical response; and personnel threats influenced the overall response. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © Operational Research Society 2020.},

abstract={Recommendation systems form the centerpiece of a rapidly growing trillion dollar online advertisement industry. Curating and storing profile information of users on web portals can seriously breach their privacy. Modifying such systems to achieve private recommendations without extensive redesign of the recommendation process typically requires communication of large encrypted information, making the whole process inefficient due to high latency. In this paper, we present an efficient recommendation system redesign, in which user profiles are maintained entirely on their device/web-browsers, and appropriate recommendations are fetched from web portals in an efficient privacy-preserving manner. We base this approach on precomputing compressed data structures from historical data and running low latency lookups when providing recommendations in real-time. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

abstract={As large volumes of online reviews are being generated, both online businesses and customers are confronted with big data challenges. Previous studies have developed various methods to predict the helpfulness of online reviews. These methods have disregarded the aspects of the business entities when dealing with datasets for prediction and evaluation and have not considered interactions between a review and the target business entity. In this paper, we propose a novel method to predict the top attractive reviews for a specific business entity. We also propose topic-related features to characterise the topics in a review and interaction features to reflect relationships between a review and the business entity it covers. Our empirical evaluation shows the utility of our proposed method and features. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

abstract={Online shopping is growing fast across the globe and so are its complexities. Fraud is a complicated phenomenon and its mitigation is critical for running a smooth business. The case considered for the present study is fraud mitigation in return–refund process managed by the customer services of an online retail business. Predictive analytics approach was used to identify early indicators of agent refund fraud–a rare event. The technique used to solve the problem was a Penalised Likelihood based Logistic Regression model. The proposed model allowed the business to select top 5% sample of refund transactions with a higher likelihood of fraud as indicated and queue them for an audit. Implementation of this model resulted in an incremental lift in fraud capture rate. © Operational Research Society 2020.},

abstract={Market basket analysis (MBA), or the mining of transactional data to uncover association rules, is a popular methodology used in managerial decision making. MBA is centered around three key parameters: support, confidence, and lift, and the choice of starting values for these parameters can have a significant impact on the results of the analysis. We develop a procedure in R around the Apriori algorithm to help in identifying lift maximising rules when the support covers a specified proportion. The procedure facilitates the choice of minimum parameters, eliminates redundancies, and organizes the resulting association rules into actionable formats. When applied to the US auto repair data, we find un-exploited bundling packages that can be added to the scheduled maintenance services of traditional marketing campaigns. © Operational Research Society 2020.},

abstract={Large investments in analytics demonstrate that the pharmaceutical industry has embraced the value proposition of data science. This excitement however does not imply that companies, currently, have a solid understanding how data science creates value. Management rely on data scientists for the value delivery of advanced analytics. Objectives of data scientists and management are not necessarily aligned. Choices made by data scientists might be suboptimal from a wholistic corporate perspective. Conversely management might lack technical expertise. This situation is an example of a principal-agent problem. AstraZeneca is making significant investments in analytical capabilities. AstraZeneca beliefs that investment decisions should not be strictly determined by monetary objectives, instead corporate Core Values should be used as guiding principles. The relationship between objectives and attributes are captured in an objective hierarchy network. This model reduces the information asymmetry between data scientists and its leaders by creating clarity regarding the objectives pursued by AstraZeneca. © Operational Research Society 2020.},

abstract={Global news reflects the inefficiency of the current counterterrorism strategy. The number of terrorist attacks worldwide continues to grow. Multiple studies have not yet discovered how the configuration of links among terrorists drives their choice of attack. Using “the starfish and the spider” framework, this empirical study examines both the centralised and decentralised structures of the terrorist network. We draw the network from operational tactics of different ideologies. Focusing on the types of attacks, we explore similarities in terrorist operations, discern clusters among ideological movements, and draw the structure of terrorist networks over time. The findings contribute to an improved understanding of the operational conception of violent groups. It was found that almost half of ideological movements connect through clusters with several links stable over decades. These networks transformed from a centralised (spider) hierarchy to a decentralised (starfish) structure and eventually evolved into the combination of two–a hybrid organisation. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

abstract={The logistic regression model is the algorithm most commonly applied in business analytics applications for classifying objects into binary categories among industrial users. This paper presents a Bayesian approach to assessing the contributions of predictors to the predictive performance of the classification model. Our proposed approach has two novel features that distinguish it from the usual approaches for such purpose. First, our approach ranks different predictors based on their contributions to variation in a model’s predictive performance, thus addressing the challenges of prediction risk and suggesting modelling strategy. Second, our approach can evaluate the contributions of every individual predictor each pair of two predictors. Hence, it can provide valuable information for managers on highly defined and detail-oriented business inquiries, complementary to the routine information conveyed by the usual methods for variable and feature selection purpose. We demonstrate the proposed approach using an example in credit risk management. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

abstract={Predicting the point spread of a professional basketball game is difficult but important for many stakeholders. We propose a new approach to predict the point spread in real time using in-game data. The approach uses a snapshot from the current game to identify historical games that have the same snapshot. After identifying these games, we predict the point spread of the current game using information obtained from the historical games. Using data obtained from six seasons of professional basketball games, we compare the prediction error of this approach to that of a deep learning technique, a long short-term memory network, and a general linear model. The proposed approach performs nearly the same as both models without the need for resource-intensive training. We discuss the robustness of this approach for making real-time predictions as games are underway. The findings have real-world implications for game enthusiasts, coaching staffs, and, most importantly, bettors. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

The approach integrates the translation of the business issue into a quantitative framework by which actual gas leak data can be analysed and modelled to measure the performance of different gas leak response strategies. An agent-based simulation model is utilized to provide a decision support platform that translates the analytic results into a visualization tool to assist stakeholders and decision makers in evaluating the impact of different response strategies. The paper highlights both the analytic methods and the related “soft skills” that must be managed in the business analytics context to ensure an outcome that is acceptable for all stakeholders. © Operational Research Society 2019.},

abstract={This study presents an approach that can be used to identify important predictors used incalculating performance rankings and gauge their sensitivities. Random Forests is a powerful machine learning tool well known for their predictive powers. It is especially suited to broach the small-n, large-p problem usually found in rankings procedures. However, random forests are unable to shed any insight intohow the examined predictors affect individual entries in the ranked set. A procedure calledLocal Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) enables decision-makers to discernthe most important individual variables and their relative contributions to the outcome ofeach element in the ranked set. To explain this procedure, we use the 2016 edition of theALEC-Laffer State Rankings data. With the method proposed in this study, a state’s policymakerswould have specific knowledge on how to improve their state’s ranking. This method is ofgeneral applicability to any policy domain. © Operational Research Society 2019.},
